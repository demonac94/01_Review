	abstract = {Systems are inherently tied to uncertainty, which necessitates the development of designs and schedules that accommodate this unpredictability. Particularly in modern power systems, the variable efficiency of numerous factors, including pricing, underscores the need for uncertainty modeling. In the meantime, the incorporation of EVs (electric vehicles) into the electrical grid is advancing, with these vehicles being recognized for their role in reducing dependency on fossil energies and enhancing the resilience, stability and efficiency of the grid. However, the rapid growth of the EV sector necessitates thoughtful strategies from decision-makers to manage its expansion effectively, particularly considering the environmental implications associated with the life cycle of EVs, including their charging and discharging processes. This research introduces the conceptual design and optimization approach utilizing a hybrid bat algorithm and differential evolution algorithm (BA-DEA) to improve the efficiency and resilience of EV-smart parking lots under the unpredictable conditions caused by grid pricing fluctuations within the DRP (demand response program). The technique effectively modulates daily costs by adjusting loads among peak and off-peak periods. Key features of the proposed approach include a non-dominated sorting model, innovative variable identification, a memory-based selection process, and the application of fuzzy theory to identify optimal Pareto outcomes. This methodology is not only swift in converging to a solution but also demonstrates a high likelihood of reaching the global optimum. Modeling considerations for smart hydrogen storage systems (SHSSs) incorporate significant constraints, notably those associated with electrolyzers, fuel cells, and storage capacities. The algorithm's effectiveness is validated in scenarios involving parking facilities and multiple uncertain resources, demonstrating a robust reduction in specific cost indicators and adjustments in cost dynamics when DRP is considered. Specifically, the algorithm achieves a substantial 42% decrease in cost variability when DRP is excluded, and a 46.9% reduction in cost variability when DRP is included, despite a minor 5% increase in average cost. These outcomes underscore the proposed system's capability to improve resilience and thermal performance under fluctuating conditions, making it a promising solution for future smart energy systems. Further, the results exhibited the complex interplay between cost optimization and operational adjustments in response to demand-side management. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In this work, the Design and Operation of Integrated Technologies (DO-IT) framework is developed, a comprehensive tool to support short- and long-term technology investment and operation decisions for integrated energy generation, conversion and storage technologies in buildings. The novelty of this framework lies in two key aspects: firstly, it integrates essential open-source modelling tools covering energy end uses in buildings, technology performance and cost, and energy system design optimisation into a unified and easily-reproducible framework. Secondly, it introduces a novel optimisation tool with a concise and generic mathematical formulation capable of modelling multi-energy vector systems, capturing interdependencies between different energy vectors and technologies. The model formulation, which captures both short- and long-term energy storage, facilitates the identification of smart design and operation strategies with low computational cost. Different building energy demand and price scenarios are investigated and the economic and energy benefits of using a holistic multi-energy-vector approach are quantified. Technology combinations under consideration include: (i) a photovoltaic-electric heat pump-battery system, (ii) a photovoltaic-electric heat pump-battery-hot water cylinder system, (iii) a photovoltaic-electrolyser‑hydrogen storage-fuel cell system, and (iv) a system with all above technology options. Using a university building as a case study, it is shown that the smart integration of electricity, heating, cooling and hydrogen generation and storage technologies results in a total system cost which is >25% lower than the scenario of only importing grid electricity and using a fuel oil boiler. The battery mitigates intra-day fluctuations in electricity demand, and the hot-water cylinder allows for efficiently managing heat demand with a small heat pump. In order to avoid PV curtailment, excess PV-generated electricity can also be stored in the form of green hydrogen, providing a long-term energy storage solution spanning days, weeks, or even seasons. Results are useful for end-users, investment decision makers and energy policy makers when selecting building-integrated low-carbon technologies and relevant policies. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The European North Sea has a vast renewable energy potential and can be a powerhouse for Europe's energy transition. However, currently there is uncertainty about how much offshore wind energy can be integrated, whether offshore grids should be meshed and to what extent offshore hydrogen should play a role. To address these questions, we use the open-source energy system optimization model PyPSA-Eur to model a European carbon-neutral sector-coupled energy system in high spatial and temporal resolution. We let the model endogenously decide how much offshore wind is deployed and which infrastructure is used to integrate the offshore wind. We find that with point-to-point connections like we have today, 310 GW offshore wind can be integrated in the North Sea. However, if we allow meshed networks and hydrogen, we find that this can be raised to 420 GW with cost savings up to 15 bn€/a. Furthermore, we only observe significant amounts of up to 75 GW of floating wind turbines in the North Sea if we have offshore hydrogen production. Generally, the model opts for offshore wind integration through a mix of both electricity and hydrogen infrastructure. However, the bulk of the offshore energy is transported as hydrogen, which is twice as much as the amount transported as electricity. Moreover, we find that the offshore power network is mainly used for offshore wind integration, with only a small portion used for inter-country transmission. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The power to gas (P2G) equipment serves as a critical linkage in integrated energy systems that foster bidirectional energy flow to enhance the share of renewable energy and curb uncertainty. By bringing together P2G hydrogen production and hydrogen injection into gas grid technology, the energy conversion loss associated with P2G applications can be significantly reduced. Nonetheless, the strict criteria concerning hydrogen blending ratios pose limitations on the integration of renewable energy. This paper proposes a comprehensive energy system model that couples gas grid hydrogen injection with a hybrid P2G process, aiming to reduce energy conversion losses and overcome the constraints posed by hydrogen blending ratios. This approach promotes the efficient utilization of renewable energy in integrated energy systems (IES). For wind power uncertainty, a scenario analysis method combining Latin hypercube sampling and scenario curtailment 0–1 algorithm is employed. The model's nonlinear constraints are linearized through piecewise linearization, transforming the problem into a mixed-integer programming one for solution simulation results demonstrate that the application of the hybrid P2G process in IES systems with hydrogen injection into gas grid technology reduces certain energy conversion stages and cost inputs compared to using only power to hydrogen conversion. This approach shows significant improvements in economic and environmental performance. The hybrid P2G scheme reduces the hydrogen blending ratio of the system to the minimum operating cost from 12 % to 6 %. At the same time, its minimum value is 20.1 thousand USD lower than that of the scheme using only power to hydrogen conversion, which is about 4.7 % of the total cost. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems have become a widely accepted method of harnessing solar energy in recent decades. In addition to the growing use of renewable energies are being used due to the depletion of fossil fuel supplies and the corresponding pollution generated by these non-renewable fuels. Since PV systems possess a limited lifespan, and are predicted to eventually become outdated, sustainability and recycling that should be incorporated into the structure of the solar system supply chain. The management of high and low moisture waste (H&LMW) is crucial due to its harmful environmental impacts, including sludge waste, carbon dioxide (CO2), and acid compounds. This study explores the integration of research on H&LMW and PV systems, focusing on energy generation from biogas, incineration power plants, and PV systems. In this respect, we propose a multi-objective mixed-integer programming model to construct a sustainable closed-loop renewable energy supply chain by considering forward and reverse flow through solar, biogas, and incineration power plants. Reducing CO2 with power-to-gas technology is thought to be an environmentally friendly approach. A novel fuzzy-random robust flexible programming approach based on Me measure is proposed, which overcomes the limitations of addressing the uncertainty of the parameters. Next, in order to solve the suggested multi-objective model, a novel strategy known as utility function based multi-choice conic goal programming is presented. A case study explores the sustainable challenges of a closed-loop renewable energy supply network in India's renewable energy sector. The experimental results indicate that 9 candidate locations are selected for solar wafer production facilities, while 10, 9, and 15 locations are chosen for solar cell production, module manufacturing, and solar power plants, respectively.

	abstract = {In recent times, there has been an amplified interest in exploring fresh applications of biogas, attributed to the rising concerns surrounding climate change and an enhanced emphasis on the utilization of renewable energy sources. This manuscript undertakes a comprehensive assessment of recent advancements in the domains of dry, bi-, and tri-reforming. Notably, it emphasizes situations in which the CO2 present in biogas assumes the role of an oxidant or partial oxidant. A comparative evaluation of various techniques and the exploration of recent catalysts employed in the reforming process and techno-economic biogas conversion applications are also deliberated in this analysis. Biogas conversion exhibits economic feasibility, typically with a payback period ranging from 4 to 8 years. Opting for a higher reaction temperature within the range of 830–900 °C is typically favored as it results in increased CH4 and CO2 conversions within the bi-reforming of the biogas process. Similarly, the temperature range is maintained between 750 and 850 °C and 850–1000 °C or above (depending on various factors) for dry reforming and tri reforming respectively. In general, biogas can undergo conversion processes to produce hydrogen, methanol, compressed natural gas, liquid fuel, wax, and form of heat. The inclusive conversion of biogas efficiency ranges from around 35%–80%, depending on the specific type of product being generated. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This work aims at investigating the potential of catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs) for ammonia production from renewable hydrogen. To achieve this objective, computer-aided process simulation is deployed using Aspen plus v14 simulation tool. A 1D model is developed to describe the integration of a ruthenium catalyst into a CMR equipped with inorganic membranes that are selective to NH3 over N2 and H2. First, the CMR performance is studied across a broad spectrum of membrane properties and operating conditions. Subsequently, the CMR model is integrated into several Power-to-Ammonia (PtA) process layouts, which are optimized and techno-economically compared against a traditional PEM-based PtA production process, employing condensation for the purification stage. Key findings at the reactor level confirmed that beyond a selectivity threshold towards hydrogen of 10–20, both the degree of conversion and recovery tend to be generally independent of the membrane's selectivity. However, for producing pure ammonia permeate, highly selective membranes (>1000 towards H2) depending on the pressure drop are found essential making this alternative elusive based on existing membranes. At the PtA level, results in terms of efficiency indicates that the use of membrane reactor increases the system efficiency by around ∼8% with respect to reference case while ∼15% enhancement is achieved with this process when using SOEC technology. When examining the final Levelized Cost of Ammonia (LCOA), incorporating a membrane reactor in conjunction with condensation separation results in a cost that nearly matches the reference case. Future research should focus on replacing the condensation process with a method of purification at lower pressures. This could potentially further improve efficiency and reduce the cost of the membrane reactor compared to the traditional one. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The transformation of fossil fuel-based power generation systems towards greenhouse gas-neutral ones based on renewable energy sources is one of the key challenges facing contemporary society. The temporal volatility that accompanies the integration of renewable energy (e.g. solar radiation and wind) must be compensated to ensure that at any given time, a sufficient supply of electrical energy for the demands of different sectors is available. Green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy sources via electrolysis, can be used to chemically store electrical energy on a seasonal basis. Reconversion technologies are needed to generate electricity from stored hydrogen during periods of low renewable electricity generation. This study presents a detailed techno-economic assessment of hydrogen gas turbines. These technologies are also superior to fuel cells due to their comparatively low investment costs, especially when it comes to covering the residual loads. As of today, hydrogen gas turbines are only available in laboratory or small-scale settings and have no market penetration or high technology readiness level. The primary focus of this study is to analyze the effects on gas turbine component costs when hydrogen is used instead of natural gas. Based on these findings, an economic analysis addressing the current state of these turbine components is conducted. A literature review on the subsystems is performed, considering statements from leading manufactures and researchers to derive the cost deviations and total cost per installed capacity (€/kWel). The results reveal that a hydrogen gas turbine power plant has an expected cost increase of 8.5% compared to a conventional gas turbine one. This leads to an average cost of 542.5 €/kWel for hydrogen gas turbines. For hydrogen combined cycle power plants, the expected cost increase corresponds to the cost of the gas turbine system, as the steam turbine subsystem remains unaffected by fuel switching. Additionally, power plant retrofit potentials were calculated and the respective costs in the case of an upgrade were estimated. For Germany as a case study for an industrialized country, the potential of a possible retrofit is between 2.7 and 11.4 GW resulting to a total investment between 0.3 and 1.1 billion €. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The expansion of fluctuating renewable energy production, such as wind and PV, increases the mismatch to consumption. Power-to-Hydrogen-to-Power (PtHtP) systems are believed to be a key for balancing under and overproductions. PtHtP systems can provide temporal and spatial flexibilities and among them reversible solid oxide cells (rSOC) are a promising technology. They combine production of hydrogen and power in the same electrochemical stack. This generates a financial and environmental benefit since less resources are necessary for enabling both Power-to-Hydrogen and Hydrogen-to-Power. This work investigates the application of rSOC systems in comparison to reversible PEM systems consisting of electrolysis and fuel cell unit. In the present studies time-resolved optimization is employed for simulation of the optimal operation of the PtHtP technologies in different market price conditions for electricity, hydrogen and natural gas and with coupling to industry and district heat. Both systems have a zone of market prices, that allows for a positive economic performance over lifetime. The electricity‑hydrogen price difference in this zone is in the range from −83 €/MWh to 133 €/MWh depending on the scenario. Furthermore, the electricity price fluctuations are found to have the major impact on the profitability. By studying the influence of gas grid fees, one finds that local compressed hydrogen storages can be used only for very short storage timescales up to a few hours. Finally, the derivation of application conditions, that are suitable for the two different spatial kinds of reversible hydrogen systems – spatially concentrated and delocalized and the two technologies – rSOC and PEM, is made. © 2024},

	abstract = {The coupling of multimedia materials and energy with sustainable energy penetration in large-scale industrial refineries significantly lowers energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents a sustainable retrofitting framework for coupled production materials and steam systems (CPMSS) utilising two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP). A novel sustainable energy-integrated CPMSS (SEICPMSS) model that includes wind, solar, and hydrogen energy and considers multiple operating modes and hydrogen consumption of the process units was established. First-principles models of wind turbines, solar thermal collectors, and proton exchange membrane electrolysers were adopted to sustainably retrofit the CPMSS. Latin hypercube sampling and Gaussian mixture model methods were applied to classify high volumes of uncertain wind speed and solar radiation data. A SEICPMSS optimisation model formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem was developed by considering the investment costs, carbon taxes, and operational costs. Finally, a series of case studies from the industrial refinery's CPMSS were conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The optimisation results indicate that the TSSP method can reduce operating costs by 5.3355 × 108 CNY/year and decrease GHG emissions by 7.4104 × 106 t/year compared to the traditional CPMSS without the integration of sustainable energy systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The goal of achieving a zero-emission energy system by 2050 requires accurate energy planning to minimise the overall cost of the energy transition. Long-term energy models based on cost-optimal solutions are extremely dependent on the cost forecasts of different technologies. However, such forecasts are inherently uncertain. The aim of the present work is to identify a cost-optimal pathway for the Italian energy system decarbonisation and assess how renewable cost scenarios can affect the optimal solution. The analysis has been carried out with the H2RES model, a single-objective optimisation algorithm based on Linear Programming. Different cost scenarios for photovoltaics, on-shore and off-shore wind power, and lithium-ion batteries are simulated. Results indicate that a 100% renewable energy system in Italy is technically feasible. Power-to-X technologies are crucial for balancing purposes, enabling a share of non-dispatchable generation higher than 90%. Renewable cost scenarios affect the energy mix, however, both on-shore and off-shore wind saturate the maximum capacity potential in almost all scenarios. Cost forecasts for lithium-ion batteries have a significant impact on their optimal capacity and the role of hydrogen. Indeed, as battery costs rise, fuel cells emerge as the main solution for balancing services. This study emphasises the importance of conducting cost sensitivity analyses in long-term energy planning. Such analyses can help to determine how changes in cost forecasts may affect the optimal strategies for decarbonising national energy systems. © 2023},

	abstract = {The complementary operation of hydropower, photovoltaic, and wind power can promote the integration of renewable energy resources into the grid. However, the competition of power transmission channels among multiple energy raises surpluses significantly. This study equips a hydrogen production plant for the hydro–wind–PV hybrid system to utilize the power surplus. First, a multi-scale nested joint operation model that considers both long-term and short-term operation strategies is proposed to simulate the operation process of the hybrid system. Then, the potential surplus of the system is evaluated and used as the power source of the hydrogen production plant. Lastly, the optimal hydrogen production plant size is determined based on economic and technical analysis. A case study is performed with the Yalong River basin of China. The results show that (McElroy and Chen, 2017 (1)) The deployment of a 260 MW hydrogen production system has the potential to boost the annual power generation benefit of the hybrid system by 610 million CNY； (2) The fluctuation of hydropower station output is effectively reduced, subsequently mitigating operational risks. Especially during flood season, the power variation coefficient experiences a notable decrease of approximately 75%； Liu and Xu (2022) (3) The deployment of hydrogen production plants is more economically feasible than expanding power transmission channels, particularly when considering long-distance power transmission. Furthermore, given that hydrogen production plants frequently operate under fluctuating power conditions, the electrolyzers and compressors must exhibit prompt responsiveness to these power variations. © 2024},

	abstract = {Today, fossil fuels used in urban transportation vehicles have great harm to the environment. In order to minimize these damages, the demand for transportation vehicles that use renewable energy sources is increasing day by day. Their high energy efficiency, zero emission values, not causing traffic congestion, saving time, no parking problems and being affordable have made the use of electric scooters (e-scooter) more advantageous than other means of transportation. Studies carried out to increase the performance of e-scooters, which have become popular in modern city life, are of great importance. With this study, we aimed to eliminate the problems encountered in electric scooters, such as short charging life of the battery, long charging times and most importantly, short driving range. For this purpose, a scooter simulation model was proposed in which a fuel cell, the energy source of the future, is used instead of a battery in an electric scooter. In addition, it is powered from the battery to be able to compare the results obtained and a scooter model with regenerative recovery was also realized. The dynamic behaviors of both models presented are compared for the first time according to long-term driving cycle conditions, and it is aimed to provide motivation to the researchers for future studies on this subject. In order to make the driving conditions more realistic in the simulation were chosen from the most popular inner city driving cycles, the European Economic Commission-15 (ECE 15), the Worldwide Harmonized Motorcycle Emissions Certification Procedure (WMTC) and the Assessment and Reliability of Transport Emission Models and Inventory Systems (ARTEMIS) Urban driving cycles. During these driving cycles, the performance of the scooter models was compared and the results were evaluated. From the results obtained from three different driving cycles, it is seen that a scooter designed using a fuel cell can provide over 120% increase in range compared to a battery scooter. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In efforts to combat carbon emissions in challenging sectors like heavy industry and shipping, Power-to-X (PtX) technology emerges as a promising solution. PtX involves converting renewable energy into hydrogen via water electrolysis and further processing it into eco-friendly fuels like methanol, ammonia, or kerosene. Denmark has seen a rise in plans for integrating large-scale PtX projects, which will introduce large electrical loads to its power system. To optimize the cost-effectiveness of PtX-based fuel production, a proposal suggests leveraging PtX plants’ inherent flexibility to provide frequency reserves to the electrical grid. The study centers on a real-life hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) dedicated to methanol production in Denmark. Analyzing the HRES technology and current reserve markets reveals that the HRES qualifies for frequency reserve provision certification, encompassing FCR, aFRR, and mFRR, by the transmission system operator. Through participation in the reserve market, the HRES can generate added revenue, resulting in substantial reductions of 12% and 30% in the levelised cost of methanol for 2020 and 2021 operational expenditure outcomes, respectively. The study illustrates significant cost reductions achievable through engagement in reserve markets, and these reductions may escalate further with increased market prices and volatility. Participating in frequency reserve capacity markets not only facilitates overall cost reduction but also serves as an insurance policy against unpredictable energy market fluctuations. This approach presents a promising trajectory to promote PtX technology adoption and nurture sustainable energy practices in challenging sectors. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The main performance indicators of hydrogen energy production should be improved. However, improving these factors also increase the operational costs of the companies. Because of this issue, there is a need for a priority analysis so that it can be possible to focus on more important factors. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to evaluate hydrogen production methods for global energy transition. In this process, a four-stage model has been proposed by getting evaluations from three different experts. Firstly, artificial intelligence-based decision-making can be implemented for expert prioritization. In the second stage, recommender system is conducted with collaborative filtering to complete the missing evaluations. Thirdly, selected criteria are weighted by using M-SWARA with QPFRS. Finally, method alternatives for hydrogen production are ranked via quantum picture fuzzy rough sets adopted VIKOR. The biggest contribution for doing this study is that artificial intelligence technique is integrated into the model and experts' importance coefficients are can be computed. Additionally, by using the collaborative filtering technique, empty evaluations can be filled scientifically. This contributes to the quality of the analysis process in many ways. Thanks to this technique, experts are given the opportunity not to answer questions they are not very sure about. The findings indicate that renewable energy expansion, energy efficiency and sustainable development are the most important criteria for global energy transition in hydrogen production. On the other side, the ranking results give information that thermal processes including steam methane reforming and biomass gasification is the most appropriate method alternatives for hydrogen production. Based on these analysis results, it is strongly recommended that research and development activities should be improved to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the renewable energy projects. With the help of this issue, it can be much easier to increase the performance of hydrogen production process. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The shared energy storage system is recognized as a promising business model for the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems (IES) to improve the utilization of energy storage and the consumption of renewable energy. As the hydrogen energy gradually receives more attention, this paper constructs the structure of a hybrid hydrogen energy storage system shared by an IES alliance in a dynamic pricing mode. A bi-level optimization model for the shared hybrid hydrogen energy storage system (SHHESS) is proposed to optimize the capacity configuration decisions and the pricing strategy jointly. The upper level determines the capacity and dynamic price of SHHESS with maximum profits and the lower level obtains the optimal operation of the IES alliance minimizing the total operation costs. The proposed model is solved by an improved PSO-GA algorithm and CPLEX solver. Finally, numerical tests are conducted in different scenarios. The results show that the hybrid energy storage system improves the daily profits of SHHESS by 70.3% and 5.44%, and reduces the renewable energy curtailment by 80.93% and 48.92% respectively compared to the battery-only and hydrogen-only systems. Additionally, the daily operation cost of the IES alliance is 35.2% lower than the individual operation scenario. The proposed model confirms the feasibility and superiority of the hybrid hydrogen energy storage system in a sharing business mode. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

We leverage on a geospatial analysis for wind and solar availability and different industrial demand profiles with the aim to identify the ideal sizing of plant components and the resulting Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH). We assess the carbon intensity of the produced hydrogen, especially when grid electricity is utilized. A methodology is developed to size and optimize the PV and wind energy capacity, the electrolyzer unit, and hybrid storage, by combining compressed hydrogen storage with lithium-ion batteries. The hydrogen demand profile is generated synthetically, thus allowing different industrial consumption profiles to be investigated. The LCOH in a baseline scenario ranges from 3.5 to 8.9 €/kg, with the lowest values in wind-rich climates. Solar PV only plays a role in locations with high PV full-load hours. It was found that optimal hydrogen storage can cover the users’ demand for 2–3 days. Most of the considered scenarios comply with the emission intensity thresholds set by the EU. A sensitivity analysis reveals that a lower variability of the demand profile is associated with cost savings.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-objective framework for sustainable scheduling of hybrid hydrogen-power systems. In the proposed model, the microgrid system incorporated renewable energy systems, battery energy storage systems, non-renewable resources, power-to-hydrogen, hydrogen-to-power, demand response programs, and hydrogen storage systems to present a highly flexible structure in the energy systems. The purpose of the proposed model is to provide a complete operation mechanism for the daily scheduling of microgrids considering environmental, economic, and sustainable problems. To this end, a stochastic three-objective optimization model is proposed to consider the intermittent behavior of renewable generation, loads, and market prices and simultaneously tries to minimize the carbon emission, total cost, and peak loads. The peak load reduction is important because it increases the reliability, renewable energy integration, power quality, and reduced cost of reserve capacity. Therefore, a min-max approach is presented to reduce the peak load in the proposed model. Also, the hydrogen-to-power and power-to-hydrogen resources are integrated as flexible resources to increase the efficiency of microgrids during operation scheduling. The proposed model is evaluated on a standard case study and the numerical results show the multi-objective model reduces the carbon emission by 28.05 kg and increases the load factor by 6.26%, respectively. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The increasing political momentum advocating for decarbonization efforts has led many governments around the world to unveil national hydrogen strategies. Hydrogen is viewed as a potential enabler of deep decarbonization, notably in hard-to-abate sectors such as the industry. A multi-modal, hourly resolved, linear programming model was developed to assess the infrastructure requirements of a low-carbon supply chain over a large region. It optimizes the deployment of infrastructure from 2025 up to 2050 by assessing four years: 2025, 2030, 2040, and 2050, and is location agnostic. The considered infrastructure encompasses several technologies for production, transmission, and storage. Model results illustrate supply chain requirements in Texas and Louisiana. Edge cases considering 100% electrolytic production were analyzed. Results show that by 2050, with an assumed industrial demand of 276 TWh/year, Texas and Louisiana would require 62 GW of electrolyzers, 102 GW of onshore wind, and 32 GW of solar panels. The resulting levelized cost of hydrogen totaled $5.6–6.3/kgH2 in 2025, decreasing to $3.2–3.5/kgH2 in 2050. Most of the electricity production occurs in Northwest Texas thanks to high capacity factors for both renewable technologies. Hydrogen is produced locally and transmitted through pipelines to demand centers around the Gulf Coast, instead of electricity being transmitted for electrolytic production co-located with demand. Large-scale hydrogen storage is highly beneficial in the system to provide buffer between varying electrolytic hydrogen production and constant industrial demand requirements. In a system without low-cost storage, liquid and compressed tanks are deployed, and there is a significant renewable capacity overbuild to ensure greater electrolyzer capacity factors, resulting in higher electricity curtailment. A system under carbon constraint sees the deployment of natural gas-derived hydrogen production. Lax carbon constraint target result in an important reliance on this production method due to its low cost, while stricter targets enforce a great share of electrolytic production. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Electrocatalytic water splitting is a very important energy conversion technology that utilizes renewable energy sources to produce hydrogen for sustainable energy development. In this work, the catalytic performance of 1T-VS2 (1T phase of vanadium disulfide) nanoribbons in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was investigated based on first-principles calculations. It was found that 1T-VS2 nanoribbons have a Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of 0.05 eV, demonstrating its excellent HER performance. Moreover, some transition metal substitutions can further improve this performance (e.g. the ΔGH* of the Ti/Fe-1T-VS2 are as low as −0.02/0.04 eV). The mechanism of the performance enhancement is thoroughly investigated. The improved catalytic performance of HER is mainly promoted by hybridization between the V-d and TM-d-orbitals. The crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (COHP) and integral crystal orbital Hamiltonian habitation (ICOHP) calculations show that the HER properties are closely related to the filling of bonding and antibonding states. The differential charge density indicates that the adsorption of H results in an effective charge transfer at the interface and an increase in the conductivity, leading to an increase in the HER. The HER activity of the TM-1T-VS2 (TM stands for transition metal) nanoribbons is also related to the proximity of the adsorption site to the edge. Our work suggests that the TM-1T-VS2 nanoribbons are expected to be low cost and highly efficient catalysts. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The study initially assesses two standalone setups: solar-battery and solar-hydrogen. Subsequently, it explores scenarios where these systems are connected to the grid to only generate and sell surplus energy. A scenario involving grid connection for self-consumption without storage serves as a benchmark for comparison. All system optimizations are designed to meet energy demands without interruptions while minimizing costs, as determined by a techno-economic analysis. The systems are sized using custom software that incorporates an energy management system and employs the Jaya algorithm for optimization. The findings indicate that selling surplus energy can be economically competitive and enhance the efficiency of grid-connected self-consumption systems, representing the study's main innovation.

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy is recognized as a crucial solution for addressing energy crises and advancing energy conservation and emissions reduction. It will play a significant role in the future integrated energy systems (IESs). However, the influence of seasonal variations in scheduling optimization of hydrogen-integrated energy system has rarely been investigated. A low-carbon scheduling model for IES, adopting multiple demand responses and a ladder-type carbon trading mechanism, has been established. Additionally, a multi-time scale dispatch optimization strategy considering seasonal hydrogen utilization is thus proposed in this paper. Specifically, day-ahead scheduling optimizes the system taking into account the seasonal variations of renewable energy and load. In the intraday stage, rolling optimization is adopted to address the forecasting errors introduced by wind and photovoltaic fluctuations. In the real-time stage, chance-constrained methods are employed to ensure short-term supply-demand balance. The efficacy of the proposed strategy is verified using real-world measurements, and the results show the multi-time scale scheduling strategy and multiple demand responses effectively enhanced the system's self-regulation capability, leading to a 12% increase in renewable energy absorption. In addition, seasonal hydrogen utilization is essential for system design, as it enhances the absorption of renewable energy, reducing the purchase cost by 4% and the total cost by 2.6%. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Currently, liquid hydrogen is the optimal way to store hydrogen, and many studies have combined it with solar energy to address the issues of low efficiency and high energy consumption during hydrogen liquefaction. However, these renewable energy sources are highly dependent on the environment and can suffer from an unstable supply. In this study, a new hydrogen liquefaction process based on solar energy utilizing a solar heat pump system is proposed to solve these problems. An absorption refrigeration system (ARS) is added to the mixed refrigerant pre-cooling and Joule-Brayton deep cooling to cool the compressor output stream during the hydrogen liquefaction process. In addition, a solar-based heat pump system to supply stable heat flow to the ARS is proposed for the first time, and a dual-circuit organic Rankine cycle to recover the residual heat from solar energy in the low-temperature and high-temperature circuits of the heat pump system (HPS) is introduced, which can be used to replenish the electric power of the compressor and other equipment in the liquefaction process. The excess cold from the hydrogen liquefaction process is used for carbon dioxide liquefaction. The process is simulated using HYSYS software, and a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for system optimization. The results show that the production of LH2 is 98 tons per day with specific energy consumption (SEC), coefficient of performance (COP), and exergy efficiency of 5.633 kWh/kgLH2, 0.217, and 53.15%, respectively; the proposed system is approximately 13% more energy efficient than the reference process. The overall liquefaction cost of the system is 22.456 M$, and the unit liquefaction cost is 0.624$/kgLH2. The energy savings and reductions achieved by converting unstable solar energy into a stable heat source for the hydrogen liquefaction process can serve as a prime reference for subsequent designs. © 2024},

In this work, a systematic assessment of the power generation based on these chemicals is performed using two different alternatives: direct utilization as green fuels in fuel cells or as carriers for hydrogen. Despite the need for a previous stage for hydrogen production, the use of these chemicals as hydrogen carriers demonstrates higher efficiencies (around 40%), mainly due to the higher degree of maturity of the hydrogen fuel cells. This is reflected in the cost of electricity for the different alternatives with around 700 €/MWh for hydrogen carrier options and about 1200 €/MWh for the direct utilization as green fuels. Compared to hydrogen, the use of methanol or ammonia has a higher electricity production cost. However, future improvements in the efficiency of fuel cell units could convert these fuels is competitive options. In addition, for different scenarios combining transportation and power generation, methanol and ammonia emerge as technically and economically feasible alternatives, especially for distances over 3000 km.

	abstract = {Given the urgent need to accelerate all renewable energy capacities for hydrogen production, this study undertakes a techno-economic analysis of dynamic hydrogen production using offshore wind energy under “slow progress” and “fast progress” scenarios. To ensure a reliable wind power generation profile and to avoid overestimating output power, the study takes into account significant impacts of air density and wind plant-level losses, including wake effect and turbine performance losses. The economic modelling incorporates costs associated with wind turbines, foundations, submarine connections, offshore substations, and installations. For modelling the system of electrolysis, a dynamic power-dependent efficiency representing PEM technology is employed. To reflect the influences of a realistic project on the estimation of the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), economies of scale and learning rate models are incorporated. Australian offshore wind locations are selected as a case study for implementing the model because of the enormous available wind resource. The findings indicate that the variable nature of input power has a meaningful impact on the yearly average energy consumption of the electrolysis system. Comparing the scenarios, it becomes evident that rapid scaling up is required to achieve a cost-competitive LCOH in the coming decades. Should interest rates and thus costs of capital return to the levels closer to pre-pandemic levels, the LCOH level of below AUD3/kg (USD2/kg) can be achieved under the “fast progress” scenario in two Australian offshore wind locations by around 2040. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen power and electric vehicle rollout are among the global mitigation efforts for net-zero emission targets. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV) is a promising embodiment of these two climate-neutral levers. Nevertheless, insufficient investigation of the life cycle of hydrogen production pathways and supply-demand mismatching jeopardize the optimal implementation of HFCV. A novel integrated framework combining life cycle greenhouse gas assessment and intra-regional supply-demand optimization method is developed to (1) evaluate the emissions performance for six typical HFCV hydrogen production pathways and (2) map out the optimal intra-regional hydrogen supply-demand allocation based on the trade-off between resource flow and geographical proximity. As one of the world's largest HFCV producers and consumers, China is chosen as the case study. The life cycle emissions assessment reveals that the Natural Gas Steam Methane Reforming (NG_SMR) pathway emits the most greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (i.e., 0.215 g CO2-eq/kJ H2) while the Clean Energy_Water Electrolysis (CE_WE) pathway emits the least GHG emissions (i.e., 0.02 g CO2-eq/kJ H2), stretching a 10-times emission difference. For intra-regional supply-demand optimization, provinces like Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Shandong act as the main suppliers (>50% of the total hydrogen source in China) to provinces like Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Sichuan, suggesting a north-to-south (N-S) regional hydrogen transmission. A sensitivity analysis is conducted based on the variation in production efficiency among different hydrogen production technologies in the HFCV value chain. The results inferred that the Coal Gasification & Carbon Capture and Storage (ClG & CCS) and CE_WE pathways are insensitive to efficiency improvement. In the scenario analysis, the outcome suggested urgently phasing out grey hydrogen pathways and accelerating the transition of grey-to-green hydrogen production pathways with the buffering of blue hydrogen pathways between 2015 and 2040 for the net-zero emission ambition by 2060.

However, dealing with uncertainties from renewable energy and load and coordinating multiple energy carriers are the main challenges for MEMG operation. In this regard, a two-stage robust operation method of electricity-gas-heat integrated MEMGs considering heterogeneous uncertainties is proposed in this paper. First, network models for an electricity-gas-heat-based distribution-level MEMG are formulated considering the dynamic characteristics of gas and heat networks. Then, the power-to‑hydrogen-and-heat unit and ladder-type carbon trading mechanism are introduced to reduce the curtailment of wind power and carbon emissions. Further, a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) method is applied to tackle uncertainties of wind power and load under extreme scenarios in the MEMG operation by iteratively solving the operation problem with the column and constraint generation (C&CG) algorithm.

	abstract = {In response to climate change and the imperative for sustainable energy solutions, this study investigates the feasibility of producing green hydrogen and associated e-fuels (methane, methanol, and ammonia) using a renewable energy hybrid system in Dakhla, Morocco. Utilizing the System Advisor Model (SAM) software for simulation-based analysis, the research evaluates a hybrid system combining concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV) plants against standalone counterparts. Various simulations comparing standalone PV and CSP plants with a novel CSP/PV hybrid concept were carried out. The hybrid system demonstrates significant promise, exhibiting increased annual energy yield and capacity factors up to 90%, leading to enhanced efficiency, performance, and cost savings with a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) approximating 17 cents/kWh. Furthermore, this paper conducts an in-depth exploration into the feasible production of hydrogen and its derived synthetic fuels utilizing hybrid renewable systems. The study provides a thorough examination of the production processes, yields, and efficiencies of hydrogen and its derivative e-fuels, with a focus on green hydrogen production through water electrolysis, CO2 hydrogenation, the Sabatier process, and the Haber-Bosch process. It sheds light on the potential applications of these fuels in the transportation sector, including in electric and hydrogen vehicles and aviation. The insights garnered are indispensable for crafting future strategies and policies in sustainable energy planning. These findings not only provide valuable direction for forthcoming initiatives in renewable energy but also underscore the pivotal role of hybridization in enhancing the efficient production and utilization of hydrogen within both renewable energy and transportation sectors. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A current challenge in energy system modelling is integrating high temporal and spatial resolution with a detailed representation of technologies and sector coupling within a single model. This paper presents a pioneering sectoral optimisation approach for transformation pathways in the German federal states. Spatial resolution in the energy system model REMod is increased and the model is extended from a single-node to a multi-node model for Germany by integrating energy exchanges between regions into a simulation-based optimisation. The approach highlights the challenge of adjusting energy distribution to address the mismatch between high final energy demand in some states and the potential for renewable energy resources in others. The extended model was compared with the results of the single-node model with the same boundary conditions. The comparison showed that increasing the spatial resolution did not significantly affect the overall cost of energy system transformation. However, the composition of the energy system changes, leading to approximately 6% more renewable capacity being installed in a scenario with ten regions. The results for the German federal states indicate a concentration of onshore wind development in the northern federal states with higher full load hours, especially in Lower Saxony/Bremen with 36 GW and Schleswig-Holstein/Hamburg/Mecklenburg-Vorpommern with 38 GW in 2045. The expansion of photovoltaic capacity in densely populated states such as North Rhine-Westphalia (73 GW), Bavaria (71 GW), and Baden-Württemberg (54 GW) reflects the need to meet growing electricity demand. The solar photovoltaic to wind power ratio varies between the federal states and influences the choice of flexibility options, including power-to-x technologies or gas and hydrogen turbines. By 2045, Germany's primary energy supply will shift to states with abundant renewable resources. Spatial flexibility is essential to balance electricity demand and solar and wind potential, mainly through state interconnections. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen emerges as a promising energy carrier in achieving carbon neutrality, especially in countries such as South Korea and Japan, where renewable energy resources are scarce. Consequently, economically importing hydrogen from overseas is paramount to a stable supply. However, previous studies have often oversimplified the estimation of hydrogen import costs with optimistic assumptions, raising doubts about their reliability. This study comprehensively assesses costs incurred from green hydrogen production to liquefaction and transportation. The cost analysis includes detailed design considerations for hydrogen liquefaction and re-conditioning plants, alongside thermodynamic simulations to estimate the boil-off gas rate of liquid hydrogen during transport. Focusing on a case study of importing liquefied green hydrogen from Australia to South Korea, our findings reveal that the levelized cost of hydrogen is approximately 30.2 USD/kgH2 as of 2023. Projections suggest a decrease to around 18.3 USD/kgH2 by 2050, assuming technological advancements, significantly exceeding values reported in the existing literature. Sensitivity analysis highlights the renewable electricity price in Australia and the boil-off rate during shipping as key factors that significantly influence the levelized cost of hydrogen. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Supply schemes, specifically delivery times, are essential factors in the resulting final cost of fuels. It is the particular case of hydrogen produced from variable renewable energies. However, the impact of different delivery times on the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) remains unclear. This paper assesses the combined impact of different delivery times, local renewable sources, and onsite generation curtailment on the LCOH. We developed an optimization model of an electrolysis-based hydrogen plant and found key LCOH locational drivers and trends. The model uses hourly solar PV and wind generation data for four locations in Chile and optimizes the capacities of the onsite solar and wind generators, electrolyzers, storage tanks, and compressors. In all the locations examined, we found an almost linear relationship between LCOH and delivery time. LCOH values for a daily delivery range from 2.4 to 3.4 $US/kg (for different locations). Values for a delivery time of 120 days range from 12.2 to 13.6 $US/kg. These are explained by the almost linear increase in storage costs with respect to delivery time, despite the variability of renewable energies at the analyzed locations. Production costs remain almost constant for different delivery times. Furthermore, we obtained that curtailment could decrease LCOHs between 5% and 40%, by increasing the electrolyzer's capacity factor and decreasing the storage size. Moreover, we show that off-grid solar-dominant scenarios are strongly affected by the lack of solar energy in winter, increasing LCOHs considerably. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is characterized by zero carbon emissions and high energy density, which can effectively support the consumption of a high proportion of intermittent new energy. Considering the seasonal nature of renewable energy sources, a seasonal hydrogen storage model is incorporated in an electric-hydrogen integrated energy system (EH-IES). In this paper, a two-layer optimization method is proposed for EH-IES with seasonal hydrogen storage. The problem of co-optimizing the equipment capacity and configuration in the proposed system is coordinated by establishing a two-layer optimization framework. Specifically, the system is optimized to minimize cost and carbon emissions at the upper layer using the multi-objective stochastic paint optimizer (MOSPO) algorithm, with the capacity configuration results being transmitted to the lower layer. The lower layer, aiming to reduce the total system cost, utilizes a commercial solver to obtain the optimal economic scheduling results for a typical day. The final analysis of the four scenarios shows that the increase in renewable energy reduces the purchasing cost of electricity by 1.89%, while in contrast, the total cost increases by 4.4% in the system with a lower proportion of renewable energy. In the case of higher heating and cooling loads, the increase in renewables reduces the purchase cost of natural gas by 9.10%. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can leverage the seasonal complementary benefits to drive new energy consumption, enhance system operation efficiency, and effectively reduce EH-IES's total operation cost and carbon emission. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is known as the fuel for 21st century, the best and clean method to produce hydrogen is electrolysis of water. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of vital position in water splitting, enabling the production of clean hydrogen fuel and contributing to renewable energy solutions. However, the inherently sluggish nature of the OER presents a major challenge for practical water electrolysis but at the same time electrocatalysts play a pivotal role by overcoming this challenge through accelerating the reaction kinetics and reducing the energy requirements. In the realm of electrocatalysts for OER, cobalt-based materials have gained significant attention due to their low overpotential and cost-effectiveness. Among prepared catalysts, the CoSe/CoO heterostructure has emerged as a standout performer, offering an optimal balance of efficiency and minimal overpotential. This electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance, featuring a low 1.31 V onset potential (vs. RHE) and a mere 170 mV overpotential at a current density of 40 mA/cm2 for OER, setting a new standard for Co-based catalysts. Moreover, the CoSe/CoO heterostructure surpasses Co based bench mark electrocatalysts by displaying the lowest overpotential. Moreover, when subjected to controlled potential electrolysis at 1.65 V (vs. RHE) with a stable current density of 60 mA/cm2, it showcases remarkable electrochemical stability, affirming its practicality for real-world applications. The hydrothermal synthesis of CoSe, CoO, and their heterostructure (CoSe/CoO) represents a straightforward and accessible approach, rendering them as promising candidates for water splitting, specifically in the context of oxygen evolution. These outstanding results achieved with non-precious metal electrocatalysts open new avenues for practical OER applications, providing a platform for the scientific community to advance the development of effective electrocatalysts using non-noble metals in the field of electrochemical water splitting. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The sultanate of Oman is among the countries that have a significant green hydrogen potential, as evident by the national target of producing one million tons of green hydrogen by 2030. This paper aims to study the techno-economic viability of integrating a floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) system with hydrogen energy storage for electricity generation in Oman. The integration of this system is modelled and simulated using HOMER Pro software to determine the optimum component sizes with the minimum cost of energy (COE). While the FPV system is designed and simulated using PVsyst software. The simulated system incorporates a 26.57 MWp FPV system, 22 MW PEM electrolyser, 13 MW PEM fuel cell, 60,000 kg hydrogen tank and 12.4 MW converter and generates 65.5 GWh of clean electricity annually. The system produces 826,624 kg of green hydrogen annually, significantly contributing to Oman's green hydrogen economy. The simulation results reveal a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of $0.97/kWh and a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of $29.7/kg. The relatively high LCOH is attributed to the utilisation of large-scale hydrogen energy storage components, which results in a higher initial cost of the system. However, the system demonstrated its ability to meet the electrical demands of 422 households near Wadi Dayqah dam area in Qurayat with minimal capacity shortage, emphasising its technical viability. The economic viability may be improved in the future with advancements in hydrogen energy storage technology and rising fossil fuel prices. © 2024 The Authors},

This paper presents a multi-energy EV station, accommodating both electricity and hydrogen refueling needs. This dual functionality increases system flexibility and simultaneously supports the adoption of BEVs and FCEVs. Unlike existing studies that consider only limited design options in EV station designing, this study modeled and optimized fifteen multi-energy EV station designs, combining renewable and non-renewable resources. These designs were evaluated against sustainability criteria covering technical, economic, environmental, and sociopolitical dimensions. The decision-making model used the AHP to weigh various criteria and employed methods such as GRA, MOORA, EDAS, TOPSIS, and VIKOR for ranking design alternatives. The planning model identified Design 14 as the optimal choice for the targeted site. This optimal design is cost-effective, offering a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of 0.046 $/kWh and a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 3.907 $/kg. It outperforms the baseline design economically, reducing the LCOE by 1.97 times and LCOH by 1.35 times. Environmentally, it decreases emissions by 514.2 t/year compared to the grid. The station can operate safely with established safety measures. Results are benchmarked against other studies from various sites, and a sensitivity analysis on uncertain parameters elucidated expected variations in the outcomes. The presented EV station planning model can be applied worldwide, considering the meteorological conditions of the specific site. © 2023},

This study explores pathways for electrifying syngas production, targeting its utilization in low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch (LT-FT) technology with a hydrocarbon production capacity of 222 kton/yr. Three electrified scenarios are juxtaposed against a reference case of autothermal reforming of biomethane. In the first two scenarios, H2 is produced via water electrolysis, with CO obtained either through CO2 electrolysis (Electrolysis case) or electrified reverse water-gas shift (E-rWGS case). The third scenario leverages captured CO2 and biomethane for electrified combined steam and dry reforming of methane (CSDRM case), exhibiting the lowest net emissions of 0.50 tonCO2/tonproduct. All electrified scenarios achieve net negative emissions under the EU's 2030 target of 40% overall renewable energy production. A detailed techno-economic analysis reveals significant feasibility challenges with the Electrolysis, E-rWGS, and CSDRM cases exhibiting a Levelized Cost Of Production (LCOP) of $501, $457, and $251 per barrel (bbl) of Fischer-Tropsch crude, respectively. Future projections suggest considerable capital cost reductions for electrolyzers, potentially rendering the Electrolysis case feasible, particularly under extremely low electricity prices of 3.3 $/MWh. Careful consideration of green electricity and CO2 utilization scenarios is vital for implementing CO2-negative technologies effectively. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {As one of the most promising large-scale de-fossilization technologies currently available, Power-to-Gas (P2G) is expected to promote utilization of renewable sources and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas. Through the coupling of P2G, Combined Heat and Power (CHP) as well as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), the P2G–CCS–CHP microgrid energy system could achieve hierarchical energy transfer and green-powered interconversion of gas, electricity and heat flows. However, the conversion of multiple energy shapes between different facilities is deeply intertwined with renewable energy sources, greatly increasing risk of unbalance operation and impacting the overall robustness and economic viability of system. To address these challenges, this study proposes a decision-making framework based on Information Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) method for a P2G–CCS–CHP system. The real-time balancing of heat & power loads and supply, the mechanism of gas-electricity-heat interaction, as well as recycling pattern of synthetic fuel within the system are carefully addressed to achieve optimal operation. Different scheduling schemes are obtained by setting up two separating decision principles, namely risk-seeking (RS) and risk-avoiding (RA), to solve these uncertainties and ensure robust decision making. Meanwhile, adaptability of decision-making methodology is analyzed based on several criteria including share of recycled green-powered fuel, ecological friendliness, carbon trading benefit, etc. Results show that adding of P2G module enables a 12.6% reduction in carbon emissions and generates 1252.2 kg of green powered gas, highlighting the eco-friendly nature of the multi energy system (MES). About 21.5% of the renewable energy flows participate the interconversion of electric-heat-gas and about 17.7% of total carbon flow is circulated as synthetic fuel within the system. In addition, conservative tendency is witnessed in the case of risk-seeking decision mode, leading to an approximate 13.22% increase in the operation costs, compared with risk-avoiding mode. The proposed IGDT decision strategy has shown significant compatibility in dealing with the impact of multiple uncertainties. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Although low emission hydrogen has the prospect of huge growth in the future, the cost challenge hinders the deployment and makes it weak in the global market share. Green hydrogen has the advantage of zero carbon emission and has achieved rapid development with the support of renewable energy. Limited by investment, electricity and technology, the large-scale application of green hydrogen faces challenges in the short term. Blue hydrogen comes from natural gas reforming, and its output is guaranteed. However, its production reaction requires high energy consumption and additional carbon emission treatment, resulting in insufficient sustainability. To solve the problem of high-efficiency and large-scale production of low emission hydrogen, a hydrogen co-production scheme combining photovoltaic electrolysis and natural gas reforming with CCS was proposed in this study. Electrolytic hydrogen production, natural gas autothermal reforming, CO2 sequestration and saline purification in the cogeneration hydrogen production system are coupled by energy and materials such as electricity, O2, CO2 and water. The scheme is applied in Sichuan-Chongqing region to verify the feasibility and effectiveness. The results show that the proposed hydrogen co-production scheme can achieve cost reduction of up to 16.4%, and has long-term development prospects. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

However, there is a lack of environmental and economic trade-offs for alternative production in the low-carbon transition. This study presents an assessment framework for analyzing the environmental-economic tradeoff indicators of replacing traditional hydrogen production pathways with green alternatives, with an illustrative example drawn from the baseline scenario in which green hydrogen replaces coal for hydrogen production in China. The production system for green hydrogen in China will be competitive with traditional methods by 2030, leading to a significant transition. The priority order of the renewable energy technology portfolio for hydrogen production via water electrolysis is PV-ALK > WP-ALK > WP-PEM > PV-PEM. Regions with high trade-off indicators have the comprehensive benefit of promoting green hydrogen substitution, and Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, and Xinjiang have lower decarbonization costs and can obtain better abatement benefits. The system of trade-off indicators from the perspective of emission reduction can guide the selection of green hydrogen production technologies and project planning and will be further improved. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The production of green hydrogen through electrolysis, utilizing renewable energies, is recognized as a pivotal element in the pursuit of decarbonization. In order to attain cost competitiveness for green hydrogen, reasonable generation costs are imperative. To identify cost-effective import partners for Germany, given its limited green hydrogen production capabilities, this study undertakes an exhaustive techno-economic analysis to determine the potential Levelized Cost of Hydrogen in Germany, Norway, Spain, Algeria, Morocco, and Egypt for the year 2050, which represents a critical milestone in European decarbonization efforts. Employing a stochastic approach with Monte Carlo simulations, the paper marks a significant contribution for projecting future cost ranges, acknowledging the multitude of uncertainties inherent in related cost parameters and emphasizing the importance of randomness in these assessments. Country-specific Weighted Average Cost of Capital are calculated in order to create a refined understanding of political and economic influences on cost formation, rather than using a uniform value across all investigated nations. Key findings reveal that among the evaluated nations, PV-based hydrogen emerges as the most cost-efficient alternative in all countries except Norway, with Spain presenting the lowest Levelized Cost of Hydrogen at 1.66 €/kg to 3.12 €/kg, followed by Algeria (1.72 €/kg to 3.23 €/kg) and Morocco (1.73 €/kg to 3.28 €/kg). Consequently, for economically favorable import options, Germany is advised to prioritize PV-based hydrogen imports from these countries. Additionally, hydrogen derived from onshore wind in Norway (2.24 €/kg to 3.73 €/kg) offers a feasible import alternative. To ensure supply chain diversity and reduce dependency on a single source, a mixed import strategy is advisable. Despite having the lowest electricity cost, Egypt shows the highest Levelized Cost of Hydrogen, primarily due to a significant Weighted Average Cost of Capital. © 2024 The Authors},

For all voyage and fuel scenarios the combination of hydrogen and fuel cells uses 30% less renewable energy than ammonia and 26% less than methanol.

Sustainable and cost-effective hydrogen production will provide valuable addition to the renewable energy mix and help minimize greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigates the performance of in-situ hydrogen production (IHP) process, using a full-field compositional model as a precursor to experimental validation The reservoir model was simulated as one geological unit with a single point uniform porosity value of 0.13 and a five-point connection type between cell to minimize computational cost. Twenty-one hydrogen forming reactions were modelled based on the reservoir fluid composition selected for this study. The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the reactions were obtained from published experiments due to the absence of experimental data specific to the reservoir. A total of fifty-four simulation runs were conducted using CMG STARS software for 5478 days and cumulative hydrogen produced for each run was recorded. Results generated were then used to build a proxy model using Box-Behnken design of experiment method and Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel. To ascertain accuracy of the proxy models, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the variables. The average absolute percentage error between the proxy model and numerical simulation was calculated to be 10.82%. Optimization of the proxy model was performed using genetic algorithm to maximize cumulative hydrogen produced. Based on this optimized model, the influence of porosity, permeability, well location, injection rate, and injection pressure were studied. Key results from this study reveals that lower permeability and porosity reservoirs supports more hydrogen yield, injection pressure had a negligible effect on hydrogen yield, and increase in oxygen injection rate corelated strongly with hydrogen production until a threshold value beyond which hydrogen yield decreased. The framework developed in the study could be used as tool to assess candidate reservoirs for in-situ hydrogen production. © 2024 The Authors},

Substituting the use of fossil fuel in the road transport sector with hydrogen fuel generated from renewable sources can lead to environmental advantages. This study investigated a comprehensive analysis of three hybrid energy systems e.g., Photovoltaic -wind turbine-fuel cell-battery, Photovoltaic-wind turbine-battery, and Wind turbine-fuel cell-battery for hydrogen production and refueling station in the city of Muscat using Hybrid Optimization Model for Electrical Renewable (HOMER) software that assesses the viability of energy system to meet the required energy needs. The evaluation of the hybrid energy arrangements relies on the assessment of the renewable energy capacity at the location, the expenses, and optimization associated with different components, and the hydrogen demand. The results of the techno-economic analysis showed that the photovoltaic-wind turbine-battery energy system has the lowest net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy, and levelized cost of hydrogen of $ 529,361, $/kWh 0.0158, and $/kg 0.401 respectively, adjudging the system to be the most viable system for the refueling station in Muscat. The optimized result showed that the P-WT-B energy system comprised of 1000 kW of PV panel, 660 kW wind turbine, a 500 kW electrolyzer, a 100 1 kW h battery, a 1000 kg/L hydrogen tank, and a 492-kW converter that offered the lowest cost of energy, hydrogen, and net present cost compared to other energy systems.

This work investigates the dynamic conversion of boil-off gas (BOG) using steam methane reforming (SMR) to produce H2 within liquified natural gas (LNG) process. The study extends beyond technical considerations to encompass a socio-economic approach, exploring optimal H2 allocation to different monetization techniques (e.g., ammonia and methanol) subject to final market price and demand data. Dynamic simulation showed an excellent ability to address the variations in BOG flow, change in LNG temperature and pressure drop within the LNG supply chain, highlighting the need for adaptive flowrate and process setpoints. The H2 productivity and yield are dependent on steam flow rates, steam to carbon ration (S/C) and energy input to the system. Optimizing the reformer temperature is the best practice to enhanced the conversion of BOG to H2. Allocating approximately 74% of the produced H2 to CO2-free ammonia production, and the remainder to methanol via CO2 hydrogenation, achieves an annual profitability of $1.36 billion. However, when considering variable demand and price data over ten years, the model proposes flexible annual H2 allocation to both monetization routes, resulting in an average yearly profitability of $6.84 billion. These findings underscore the importance of integrating interactive simulation approaches to address exogenous and endogenous uncertainties, providing a robust strategy against risks. The comprehensive approach presented in this study contributes to the understanding and strategic planning of H2 production within LNG supply chains, emphasizing adaptability and economic viability in the dynamic landscape of the energy transition. © 2024 The Authors},

Hydrogen is considered the prospective solution for sustainable energy due to its dual nature as a carbon-neutral fuel and an efficient storage medium for renewable energy sources. So, in this work, a standalone new hybrid energy system powered by solar energy for yearly power and freshwater production for building demand in New Borg El-Arab, Egypt. The system comprises photovoltaic (PV) panels, a water electrolyzer, multi-effect mechanical vapor compression desalination (MED-MVC), and fuel cells with hydrogen storage.

	abstract = {The escalating demand for renewable energy solutions and the imperative for efficient energy storage mechanisms have catalyzed the evolution of Power-to-X (PtX) technologies. Germany has the most PtX projects, accounting for 44% of all projects that have been reported. PtX encompasses a spectrum of processes engineered to convert surplus renewable energy into versatile energy carriers or chemical commodities, such as hydrogen, methane, or synthetic fuels. The Paramount to this domain is to synergistically harness renewable energy sources and hydrogen carriers to curtail waste and bolster sustainability. Central to achieving this synergy is the effective control of PtX processes, ensuring optimal performance, cost efficiency, and seamless integration within existing energy frameworks. This paper delves into the control processes and environmental prerequisites within the PtX landscape, elucidating key challenges, and strategies within this dynamic realm. While providing an initial overview of fundamental PtX process chains, this paper accentuates the critical role of geographical considerations. Subsequently, it conducts a thorough analysis of equipment modeling challenges, addressing performance metrics, operational requisites, and capital investments, particularly focusing on methanol and hydrogen production and storage.

	abstract = {Fuel cell electric buses (FCBs) have proven to be a technically viable solution for transportation, owing to various advantages, such as reliability, simplicity, better energy efficiency, and quietness of operation. However, large-scale adoption of FCBs is hindered by the lack of extensive and structured infrastructure and the high cost of clean hydrogen. Many studies agree that one of the significant contributors to the lack of competitiveness of green hydrogen is the cost of electricity for its production, followed by transportation costs. On the one hand, to reduce the investment cost of the electrolyzer, high operating hours should be achieved; on the other, as the number of operating hours decreases, the impact of the electricity costs declines. This paper presents an innovative algorithm for a scalable hydrogen refuelling station (HRS) capable of successfully matching and identifying the most cost-efficient levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) produced via electrolysis and connected to the grid, based on the HRS components' cost curves and the hourly average electricity price profile. The objective is to identify the least-cost range of LCOH by considering both the electric energy and the investment costs associated with a hydrogen demand given by different FCB sizes and electrolyzer rated powers. In addition, sensitivity analyses have been conducted to quantify the technology cost margins, and a cost comparison between the refuelling of an FCB fleet and the recharging infrastructure required for an equivalent fleet of Battery Electric Buse (BEB) has been performed. An LCOH of around 10.5 €/kg varying from 12 €/kg (2 FCB) to 10.2 €/kg (30 FCB) has been found for the best-optimized configurations. The final major conclusion of this paper is that FCB technology is currently not economically competitive. Still, a cost contraction of the electric energy price and the electrolyzer capital investment would lead to a 50% decrease in the LCOH. Furthermore, increasing renewable energies into the grid may shift the electricity cost curve, resulting in higher prices when the BEB recharging demand is more significant. This impact, in addition to the peak power load and longer recharging times, might contribute to bridging the gap with FCBs. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Energy hubs (EHs) represent a pivotal paradigm in achieving optimal resource utilization across various energy domains. This paper presents an advanced framework for the optimal management of a smart island, leveraging the synergies within the water-electricity nexus. By integrating diverse resources, including electricity, water, heat, and hydrogen, the proposed EH model aims to meet the multifaceted demands of consumers on the island. To enhance operational efficiency, this study delves into the nuanced impacts of key EH components, elucidating their roles in meeting demand profiles and minimizing operational costs. Formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, the EH optimization problem is addressed using the GAMS optimization tool. The overarching objective is to fulfill consumer demand while concurrently optimizing resource utilization, considering factors such as storage degradation costs and emissions from fossil-fuel-based units. In addition to strategic optimization, this study pioneers a novel approach to stochastic parameter forecasting, integrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long-short-term memory networks (LSTMs). By harnessing the capabilities of these advanced forecasting techniques, the EH model can anticipate dynamic changes in demand patterns with heightened accuracy and precision. The empirical results underscore the transformative potential of the proposed EH framework, showcasing significant reductions—up to 30%—in emission costs. Moreover, the study underscores the pivotal role of EHs as enablers for scaling up renewable energy penetration, offering a robust foundation for sustainable energy transitions in island communities and beyond. Additionally, implementing a load-shifting demand response program can lower total costs by approximately $257 per day, offering significant savings for EHs over extended periods. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen emerges as a vital solution for mitigating the variability of renewable energy sources, acting as a stable buffer to their unpredictable nature. This study concentrates on developing an optimal green hydrogen system, tailored to manage fluctuations in renewable energy production and diverse hydrogen demand patterns. Our comprehensive model integrates inputs from wind turbines and photovoltaic systems with proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis, and includes energy storage options like batteries and hydrogen storage tanks. Analyzing data on renewable energy availability, equipment costs, and operational efficiencies yields crucial indicators for assessing economic viability and reliability: the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) and the Loss of Hydrogen Probability (LOHP). These indicators serve as dual objectives in our multi-objective optimization framework, which seeks to determine the most effective system configuration and size. The simulation results illustrate the impact of varying demand scenarios on economics and reliability, highlighting the necessity of combining renewable sources with adequate energy buffering to achieve LOHP below 2%. The optimization outcomes reveal a trade-off between cost and reliability, indicating that configurations incorporating both wind and solar can achieve an LCOH under 10 USD/kg while maintaining nearly zero LOHP. Our findings from the multi-objective optimization by demand scenario provide comparative economic insights for each renewable energy source, guiding optimal combinations according to desired reliability levels. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Industrial electrification is a crucial strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and tackling the challenge of renewable energy consumption. With the advancement of low-carbon electricity, chemical process electrification has garnered extensive attention. This work focuses on the electrification reconfiguration and carbon emission reduction of traditional chemical process, which mainly concerns the indirect electrification of processes and direct electrification of utilities, using the state-of-the-art Coal-to-Ethylene glycol (CtEG) process as a case study. The conventional CtEG process results in high CO2 emissions due to water gas shift reaction. The indirect electrification path of the conventional CtEG process is achieved by introducing green hydrogen from solid oxide electrolysis cell technology (SOEC-CtEG). Electric heaters are directly used for the hot utility in SOEC-CtEG process to form a semi-electrification scenario (SES). To investigate the performance of different electrification levels, the full-electrification scenario (FES) is also designed. The results showed that the total CO2 emissions for the four scenarios are 3.047, 0.576, 0.278 and 0.334 t/t EG, with energy efficiencies of 47.86%, 50.11%, 50.07% and 46.74%, respectively. Production costs are 3024.4, 3497.4, 3869.4, and 6147.8 CNY/t EG, respectively.

As a case study, a stand-alone microgrid located on a small island in southeastern Sardinia (Italy) and already equipped with a photovoltaic (PV) system coupled with batteries is chosen. To evaluate the integration benefits of the two storage systems (hydrogen and batteries) and the optimal sizing of the hydrogen storage section, a parametric analysis with a simulation model implemented in the MATLAB environment has been carried out. Results show that the optimal integration between the two storage systems is found by imposing a share of the batteries (18 kWh, 50% of the overall battery capacity) to exclusively supply the load demand (called battery energy buffer). In these conditions, an almost 100% self-sufficiency of the microgrid can be achieved by a hydrogen generator with the lowest size considered (2.4 kW), a hydrogen storage volume of 10 m3 and a fuel cell, mainly able to completely cover the night loads, of 1.5 kW. This sizing leads to a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for the hydrogen section of about 10.5 €/kWh. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This paper presents a comparative analysis of electric and hydrogen mobility infrastructures in a remote context, i.e., an off-grid island. The assessment includes resource assessment and sizing of renewable energy power plants to facilitate on-site self-production. We introduce a comprehensive methodology for sizing the overall infrastructure and carry out a set of techno-economic simulations to optimize both energy performance and cost-effectiveness. The levelized cost of driving at the hydrogen refueling station is 0.40 €/km, i.e., 20% lower than the electric charging station. However, when considering the total annualized cost, the battery-electric scenario (110 k€/year) is more favorable compared to the hydrogen scenario (170 k€/year). To facilitate informed decision-making, we employ a multi-criteria decision-making analysis to navigate through the techno-economic findings. When considering a combination of economic and environmental criteria, the hydrogen mobility infrastructure emerges as the preferred solution. However, when energy efficiency is taken into account, electric mobility proves to be more advantageous. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Green H2 (GH) has emerged as a highly promising medium for the transportation of eco-friendly energy. The utilization of H2 as the primary operational medium in H2-based energy storage systems and fuel cells has facilitated the integration of these systems with various other renewable energy sources, rendering such integration highly viable. This review presents an overview of the current advancements in the field of GH production techniques using water electrolyzers powered by renewable energy sources. The present paper starts with a concise overview of several production techniques and a detailed analysis of various types of water electrolyzer. It also offers a thorough examination of H2 production methods utilizing solar, wind, and hybrid systems. An economic evaluation of GH production was analyzed by comparing the costs associated with different renewable sources. This study focuses on investigating the challenges and advantages of GH and the implementation of large-scale commercial operations. The proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE) technologies boast higher current densities (1-2Acm−2) than alkaline water electrolyzer (AWE); the PEMWE technologies also produce a higher purity of H2 up to 99.9999 %. The wind energy-associated PEM LCOH ranges from 5.3 to 9.29 $/kg. AWE had levelized cost of H2 (LCOH) of 7.49–7.59 $/kg. Other studies show that SOE-based LCOH ranges from 6 to 9.34 $/kg and should drop to 1.9 $/kg by 2050.

	abstract = {The location and quantity of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) play a crucial role in the development and promotion of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). This study proposes a multi-period urban HRSs site selection and capacity planning with many-objective optimization framework for hydrogen supply chain (HSC). Firstly, the city's multi-period hydrogen requirement is predicted based on a generalized Bass diffusion model. Using publicly available data, including gas station network data, geographic information system (GIS) data, population data, and regional economic data, a spatially aggregated demand model is established to allocate hydrogen requirement at candidate sites in the city of the geographic grid model with a 1 km resolution. On this basis, four interrelated objective functions (total investment cost, hydrogen requirement coverage, risk coefficient, and environmental factors) are developed. The third-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) are employed to achieve multi-period urban HRSs site selection and capacity planning with many-objective optimization for HSC. By comparing the results of single-objective optimization focusing on minimum cost and maximum hydrogen requirement coverage, it is observed that many-objective optimization achieves a better balance among the four conflicting objectives. After comprehensive analysis, the distribution of HRSs exhibits a clustered structure, influenced by the population and economic structure of the city. In the initial stages of HFCV development, most stations serve the peripheral areas around the city center; while n the later stages of the optimization period, a few high-capacity HRSs begin to concentrate in the city center. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Besides the renewable energy's impact on the hydrogen production system (HPS) design, we analyze the effect of country-specific interest rates on the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) production. Over one-third (40.0%) of all cells have an installed solar PV capacity share between 50% and 70%, 76.4% have a hybrid (onshore wind and solar PV) configuration. Hydrogen storage is deployed rather than battery storage to balance hydrogen production via electrolysis and hydrogen demand. Hybrid HPSs can significantly reduce the LCOH production compared to non-hybrid designs, whereas country-specific interest rates can lead to significant increases, diminishing the relative competitiveness of countries with abundant renewable energy resources compared to countries with fewer resources but fewer investment risks. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Utilizing renewable energy for hydrogen production and blending it into natural gas networks is recognized as a promising approach to promote a low-carbon transformation of power systems and enhance the integration of renewable energy sources. However, the temporal and geographical availability of renewable energy and natural gas operation conditions vary greatly, emphasizing the importance of precise planning and operational strategies for the renewable energy‑hydrogen-natural gas coupling system. This article introduces a smart design and operational strategy for a wind electricity‑hydrogen-natural gas coupling system aimed at enhancing renewable energy accommodation. The primary objectives are to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of such coupling systems and to determine the optimal planning and operation strategies for hydrogen production, transportation, and blending into natural gas networks while minimizing total investment and operational costs. By utilizing real curtailed electricity data and natural gas pipeline network operating flow rate data, the potential of this coupling system to enhance renewable energy accommodation and reduce carbon emissions is explored. The results indicate that this optimized coupling system can accommodate 20.11% of curtailed wind electricity and reduce carbon emissions by 1.05 billion tons per year. Additionally, the impact of hydrogen blending ratios and hydrogen prices on the economic and environmental performance of the coupling system is also investigated. Improving the hydrogen blending ratio is the key to enlarging the economic and environmental performance of the coupling system, but the hydrogen sale price has a negligible impact on the renewable energy accommodation and environmental performance of the coupling system. © 2024},

	abstract = {While there is a broad agreement in academia and the business community that hydrogen (H2) could significantly contribute to energy policy goals, there is no single shared vision of a sustainable hydrogen supply chain (HSC). The large number of sources for hydrogen production (various fossil fuels, biomass, water) and the different methods for extracting, distributing, and storing it make creating an efficient supply chain a challenge. The commonly used optimization techniques based on linear programming require a new mathematical problem to be formulated and solved for each case. Instead, this study aims to develop an innovative optimization approach for the hydrogen supply chain that does not require complete knowledge of the end-user hydrogen demand and applies to any region. Based on the Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) method, hybrid Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach, the integral eco-efficiency indicator constructed by this approach is a weighted linear combination of economic parameters (CAPEX and OPEX) and environmental parameters (ecotoxicity, oxidation potential, eutrophication potential and climate change). The proposed approach has been tested on 22 different hydrogen supply chain options, confirming its efficiency and ability to inform national and international decision-making. For example, a pan-European decision support system could be based on continuously updated data from the EcoInvent database on environmental parameters of hydrogen production, storage, and transport technologies, and updated data on economic parameters from the European Hydrogen Observatory. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A macro-scale electricity model was used to evaluate whether wind and solar generation, combined with short- and long-duration energy storage, could cost-effectively provide 100% of Oahu's electricity. A least-cost renewable electricity system was developed with 100% of hourly averaged demand met, based on 14 consecutive years of hourly wind and solar resource and electricity demand data. The system used current asset costs for wind generation, solar generation, short-duration battery storage, and long-duration hydrogen energy storage. Our results indicate that Oahu could transition to an electricity system reliant on wind and solar generation and battery and hydrogen storage with electricity costs lower than today's electricity costs. For Oahu, a least-cost wind-solar-battery electricity system that would have met 100% of hourly averaged demand would have a system cost of $0.2458 per kWh. In comparison, from October 2022 through September 2023, electricity generation costs from the petroleum-dominated electricity system on Oahu were between $0.2126/kWh and $0.2987/kWh. This wind-solar-battery system would require 332 km2 (21.4%) of Oahu's land. Moreover, including hydrogen storage as a second form of energy storage led to reductions in system cost and land use. At current asset costs, a least-cost wind-solar-battery‑hydrogen electricity system that would have met 100% of hourly averaged demand would have a system cost of $0.1673/kWh and require 265 km2 (17.1%) of Oahu's land. This case study indicates that other isolated regions with similar resource profiles and a reliance on imported petroleum fuels could realize a decrease in electricity system costs when switching to renewables in conjunction with short- and long-duration energy storage, at current asset costs, while meeting demand in full over extended periods of renewable resource variability. © 2024},

	abstract = {Large-scale storage of ‘green’ hydrogen is essential in our quest to transition to renewable energy sources and achieve the net-zero emission targets. As such, Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) in geological porous media, such as in depleted oil and gas fields or saline aquifers, provides a cost-effective solution to store such large volumes of hydrogen (H2) to buffer seasonal fluctuations in renewable energy supply and demand. Due to the novelty of the topic, many research gaps persist, but we focus on H2 transport characteristics in the subsurface, hydrogen recoverability during cyclic operations, chemical interactions, and acoustic velocity as an indicator of H2 saturation. In this study, we investigate UHS using a triaxial core-flooding experiment to address the above-mentioned research gaps by replicating field operations in the laboratory setup at representative subsurface conditions. Unstable displacement due to immiscible two-phase flow led to early H2 breakthrough at 18% of H2 saturation, ultimate H2 saturation of 36% and withdrawal efficiency of 78% during the first cycle. However, cyclic charging and discharging led to an eventual H2 withdrawal efficiency as high as 95%. Observed chemical interactions during our 3-day experiments were negligible, but our results also indicated a strong potential for evaporation-induced salt precipitation after injection of dry H2 gas, leading to decreased reservoir porosity and permeability over time. Our ultrasonic measurements confirmed the sensitivity of P-wave velocity to H2 saturation, which decreased by 3.5% when the H2 saturation increased to 36%. This indicates that H2 plume and leaks in UHS should be possible to monitor using 4D seismic surveys. Our results help to better understand H2 flow, storage, and transport during cyclic UHS. The results indicate that H2 withdrawal efficiency increases as the UHS reservoir matures and provides evidence of a dry near-well zone and evaporation induced salt precipitation in a UHS reservoir. © 2024},

	abstract = {This research presents a novel approach that analyzes the water requirements for hydrogen production associated with a nationally adopted Green Hydrogen strategy. Green Hydrogen production is one of the most relevant technologies for massive renewable energy integration in transport systems, industries, or heating systems. European Union has launched a strategic roadmap for green hydrogen generation and integration in the energy chain. Spain aims to be one of the most important producers and exporters and has approved a Hydrogen Roadmap for next years, but no previous research has focused on the water requirements. This research finds that Spain's Green Hydrogen Roadmap, and a similar European one, is based on electrolyzers' peak capacity, and this causes a large uncertainty in real hydrogen production and associated water requirements. Spain represents a case study that can be a reference worldwide as it suffers from increasing droughts, has considerable tourist pressure, and is one of the most important producers of greens and fruits. This study proposes a methodology to quantify actual hydrogen production and associated water requirements and proves that current large-scale planning based on peak generation will produce a large uncertainty and could directly impact water supply security. One of the most relevant findings is that hydrogen production and water requirements must be included in these strategies to avoid future water supply tensions. An analysis of alternative water supply using desalinated water analyzes its feasibility and the effects on final cost. The outcomes are an example to be applied in similar scenarios worldwide and prove the need for an integrated energy-water-food strategy to deploy green hydrogen systems. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is envisioned to become a fundamental energy vector for the decarbonization of energy systems. Two key factors that will define the success of hydrogen are its sustainability and competitiveness with alternative solutions. One of the many challenges for the proliferation of hydrogen is the creation of a sustainable supply chain. In this study, a methodology aimed at assessing the economic feasibility of holistic hydrogen supply chains is developed. Based on the designed methodology, a tool which calculates the levelized cost of hydrogen for the different stages of its supply chain: production, transmission & distribution, storage and conversion is proposed. Each stage is evaluated individually, combining relevant technical and economic notions such as learning curves and scaling factors. Subsequently, the findings from each stage are combined to assess the entire supply chain as a whole. The tool is then applied to evaluate case studies of various supply chains, including large-scale remote and small-scale distributed green hydrogen supply chains, as well as conventional steam methane reforming coupled with carbon capture and storage technologies. The results show that both green hydrogen supply chains and conventional methods can achieve a competitive LCOH of around €4/kg in 2030. However, the key contribution of this study is the development of the tool, which provides a foundation for a comprehensive evaluation of hydrogen supply chains that can be continuously improved through the inputs of additional users and further research on one or more of the interconnected stages. © 2024 The Authors},

Integrated energy systems based on solar and hydrogen energy are becoming essential to obtain uninterrupted power, especially for off-grid applications. This study focuses on the design, modeling, and evaluation of such a system that meets the energy consumption of a residence in Türkiye. The framework basically consists of photovoltaic/thermal panels (PV/Ts), batteries, a PEM electrolyzer (PEM-El), hydrogen (H2) storage tanks, and PEM fuel cells (PEM-FC). A zero-dimensional mathematical model was developed for each of the components of the system. Yearly analyses were conducted with a new control strategy based on power balancing, and dynamic variations in power generated by the PV/T panel, the SOCs of batteries, the power consumption of the PEM-El, the power generated by the PEM-FC and the amount of hydrogen in the tank were examined. The results showed that the electricity requirement of a 100 m2 house can be met continuously for a year with 20 PV/T panels (total area of 32.71 m2) with a total capacity of 62 kW, 8 batteries with a total capacity of 192 kWh, and 7 H2 storage tanks with a total capacity of 29.4 kg. It was also shown that the electricity needs of the house is met by stored hydrogen between December and April. Furthermore, the hybrid system's economic evaluation was carried out and the investment cost of the system was calculated. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The purpose of this work is to examine a case study of Blue Hydrogen production in Nuevo Leon, emphasizing the importance of developing responsible sourcing criteria for waste suppliers to limited blue hydrogen plants. The developed hybrid approach integrates various methodologies, including Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH), fuzzy rough sets, hierarchical fuzzy rough analysis, Fuzzy rough WASPAS, TOPSIS, and Best-Worst Method (BWM), providing a comprehensive framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Key findings include the identification of water conservation (E2) and job creation (S2) as the top environmental and social criteria, respectively. Supplier WC2 was identified as the top-performing waste collector, achieving a final score of 4.77. This structured methodology prioritizes product categories for hydrogen consumption, considering sustainability criteria and U.S. consumer preferences, thereby offering valuable insights for businesses navigating this evolving landscape. © Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {For the effective operation of a Power-to-Hydrogen (P2H) system that integrates renewable energy sources with an Alkaline Water Electrolyzer (AWE), precise modeling of the AWE plant is paramount. This research delves into the electrothermal dynamics of the AWE and constructs an advanced Power–Temperature–Hydrogen (P–T–H) coupling model of the AWE plant. The developed model intricately captures the pivotal role of temperature in modulating hydrogen production rates, power constraints, and system flexibility. Furthermore, to enable the application of the model to system-level optimization, we undertake a rational simplification process to transform it into a linear model. Building upon this model, we devise an optimized power scheduling strategy for the P2H system that enhances the system's economic efficiency and adaptability. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis of crucial variables such as hydrogen demand, transmission line capacity, and AWE capacity underscores the strategic insights this model offers for system development and implementation. In a word, the developed P–T–H model is well feasible for the improvement of the system's operation with AWE. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen technologies have gained momentum in recent years in the context of achieving fully renewable energy systems. Apart from the ability of electrolyzers and fuel cells to consume and generate green energy, the latest research on their technical characteristics also promotes them as providers of balancing services in both power and gas (either hydrogen or natural gas) systems. The balancing services provision is a highly uncertain process and is not scheduled in advance, however, due to signed contracts and rules, the provision of these services to the TSO is not considered as a deviation from the agreed schedule. Contrary to battery storage, whose operation only affects the power system power flows, the operation of power-to-hydrogen and hydrogen-to-power units in one system (e.g. power system) has an impact on the other system (e.g. gas) as well. Because of that, the unscheduled balancing services provision to one TSO will cause an imbalance towards the TSO in the other system. This impact remains unexplored in the available literature. In this paper, we propose a model of a PV-battery-hydrogen power plant participating in both the power and gas (hydrogen) system markets while acting as a provider of balancing services and the responsible party of its own balancing group in both systems as well. We analyze how considering the influence that energy-conversion units simultaneously have on both observed systems affects the realized profit of the power plant and we show that neglecting this impact increases the total imbalance costs of the power plant, and consequently reduces its overall profit. © 2024},

Under scenarios with higher peak demands and greater demand volatility, the LCOH increases to 6.8 EUR/kgH2 due to the need for additional renewable energy capacity.

The flexibility of the hydrogen energy system is fully exploited and incorporated into the day-ahead dispatching model. To online monitor the future security of the EH-IESs operation in an uncertain environment, a security monitoring method is proposed by combining deep learning and Monte Carlo simulation. The predetermined dispatching scheme may not ensure the security of system operation due to the uncertain output of renewable energy. Thus, an intra-day correction method based on a chance-constrained model and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is established to determine the correction scheme. Finally, the numerical experiments based on IEEE 57-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems validate that the proposed method can not only ensure the security of the system but also reduce the economic cost by about 7% and the computational burden by 99%. © 2024},

The direct load control (DLC) through hydrogen-electrical microgrids is analytically modeled for leveraging the intrinsic flexibility of demand-side multi-energy synergy. To handle the uncertainty and volatility of RE generation, a risk-averse stochastic programming method with the receding-horizon mechanism is developed. Also, the power balancing cost in scheduling objectives is represented as a conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) measure to control the risks of fully RE supply.

	abstract = {To reduce carbon emissions, generation of electricity from combustion systems is being replaced by renewable resources. However, the most abundant renewable sources – solar and wind – are not dispatchable, vary diurnally and are subject to intermittency, and produce electricity at times in excess of demand (excess production). To manage this variability and capture the excess renewable energy, energy storage technologies are being developed and deployed such as battery energy storage (BES), hydrogen production with electrolyzers (ELY) paired with hydrogen energy storage (HES) and fuel cells (FCs), and renewable natural gas (RNG) production. While BES may be better suited for short duration storage, hydrogen is suited for long duration storage and RNG can decarbonize the natural gas system. California Senate Bill 100 (SB100) sets a goal that all retail electricity sold in the State must be sourced from renewable and zero-carbon resources by 2045, raising the questions of which set of technologies and in what proportion are required to meet the 2045 target in the required timeframe as well as the role of the natural gas infrastructure, if any. To address these questions, this study combines electric grid dispatch modeling and optimization to identify the energy storage and dispatchable technologies in 5-year increments from 2030 to 2045 required to transition from a 60% renewable electric grid in 2035 to a 100% renewable electric grid in 2045. The results show that, by utilizing the established natural gas system to store and transmit hydrogen and RNG, the deployment of battery energy storage is dramatically reduced. The required capacity for BES in 2045, for example, is 40 times lower by leveraging the natural gas infrastructure with a concomitant reduction in cost and associated challenges to transform the electric grid. © 2024 The Authors},

Hydrogen (H2), recognized for its cleanliness and renewability, is poised to meet future energy requirements. Consequently, ongoing research is focused on the development of electro-active, durable, and cost-effective catalysts to replace expensive noble metal-based electrocatalysts. In this study, microscale AgBiS2 chalcogenide derived from a single crystal is reported as promising electrocatalysts for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) with a remarkably low overpotential. The physico-chemical characterization of the AgBiS2 catalyst has been investigated using various analytical techniques. The synthesized AgBiS2 catalyst exhibits excellent HER activity, manifesting a low overpotential of 86 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 44 mV dec−1, along with superior stability even after 24 h in HER at a very high current density. The developed AgBiS2 also showcased stable production when subjected to a two-electrode system. The enhanced alkaline HER activity of AgBiS2 can be attributed to its phase purity, high crystallinity, and the presence of high active sites. The observed high electrochemical performance and stability position AgBiS2 as a potential electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction.

The study evaluates the economic viability and sustainability of integrating geothermal energy into hydrogen liquefaction. The results of the LCCA contribute to the ongoing discourse on sustainable energy solutions, offering a nuanced understanding of the economic considerations associated with geothermal-assisted hydrogen liquefaction. The study serves as a model for assessing the economic feasibility of similar systems, fostering informed decision-making in the pursuit of cleaner and more economically sustainable energy pathways. This study has conducted a technical and economic investigation of liquid hydrogen production using geothermal heat and electricity effects. Geothermal water pre-cools the hydrogen by providing heat to the absorption system. Then, the electricity generated in the geothermal plant is used to work in the liquefaction cycle. The generated electricity is used to liquefy hydrogen in the liquefaction cycle. The capacity of the electricity generated from the AGPP produced here is 2621 kW. The proposed system can be achieved by pre-cooling unit H2 up to −30 °C at 120 °C and 150 kg/s geothermal source. In the liquefaction cycle, 0.84 kg/s H2 can be liquefied. As a result, the total energy efficiency of the proposed system can be calculated as 32.4% and exergy efficiency as 15.4%. The system's net present value (NPV) was calculated as 65,320,000 $. When life cycle cost analysis was performed using the levelized annual cost (LAC) method, the project's levelized cost was calculated as 7,673,000 $/yr.

Furthermore, coordinating the planning of hydrogen storage and battery energy storage systems is incorporated.

Moreover, the findings reveal that hydrogen storage alone can provide sufficient energy arbitrage, leading to a 9.6% reduction in total costs compared to the scenario where storage is disregarded. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a promising solution for the decarbonisation of several hard-to-abate end uses, which are mainly in the industrial and transport sectors. The development of an extensive hydrogen delivery infrastructure is essential to effectively activate and deploy a hydrogen economy, connecting production, storage, and demand. This work adopts a mixed-integer linear programming model to study the cost-optimal design of a future hydrogen infrastructure in presence of cross-sectoral hydrogen uses, taking into account spatial and temporal variations, multiple production technologies, and optimised multi-mode transport and storage. The model is applied to a case study in the region of Sicily in Italy, aiming to assess the infrastructural needs to supply the regional demand from transport and industrial sectors and to transfer hydrogen imported from North Africa towards Europe, thus accounting for the region's role as transit point. The analysis integrates multiple production technologies (electrolysis supplied by wind and solar energy, steam reforming with carbon capture) and transport options (compressed hydrogen trucks, liquid hydrogen trucks, pipelines). Results show that the average cost of hydrogen delivered to demand points decreases from 3.75 €/kgH2 to 3.49 €/kgH2 when shifting from mobility-only to cross-sectoral end uses, indicating that the integrated supply chain exploits more efficiently the infrastructural investments. Although pipeline transport emerges as the dominant modality, delivery via compressed hydrogen trucks and liquid hydrogen trucks remains relevant even in scenarios characterised by large hydrogen flows as resulting from cross-sectoral demand, demonstrating that the system competitiveness is maximised through multi-mode integration. © 2024 The Authors},

Green hydrogen stands out as promising among the plethora of available energy production, transportation, and storage technologies. The current study offers a general outlook on green hydrogen production utilizing solar and wind energies powering the water electrolyzers. This analysis estimates the electricity production and its production cost, hydrogen production and production cost, carbon dioxide mitigation, and estimation of the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 2030 in each African country. The results reveal that hydrogen production from solar energy outweighs that from wind. The minimum and maximum power consumption are 64.26–65.46 kWh/kgH2 for the PV/H2 system and 53.62–64.8 kWh/kgH2 for the WT/H2 system. Moreover, the LCOH ranges from 4.6 to 7.31 $/kg for the PV/H2 system and 5.6 to more than 20 $/kg for the WT/H2 system. Namibia and Egypt have significant LCOH of the PV/H2 system with 4.6 and 4.64 $/kg, while Cape Verde and Djibouti have remarkable LCOH of 5.6 and 6.37 $/kg of the WT/H2 system. The percentage reduction in LCOH is 25.23% for the WT/H2 system and 37% for the PV/H2 system due to adopting the 2030 cost scenario. Moreover, adsorption-based atmospheric water is considered a suitable solution for water supply in arid regions. Finally, the CO2 mitigation ranges from 109.8 to 177.7 kg/m2 for the PV/H2 and 0.1–50.4 kg/m2 for the WT/H2. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

To this end, this research presents a biomass-based multi-generation system with an innovative and practical design that can generate electricity, heat, and hydrogen. This system includes a modified gas turbine cycle, a supercritical CO2 (SCO2) cycle, a transcritical CO2 (TCO2) cycle, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, and a PEM fuel cell unit. This study aims to evaluate the impact of various biomass sources (paper, wood, paddy husk, and municipal solid waste) on the system performance. The proposed system has been analyzed using the first and second laws of thermodynamics. This system uses the maximum capacity to produce power, heat and hydrogen. A fuel cell unit has been used to consume hydrogen and generate more electricity. In the basic mode, the system has energy and exergy efficiencies of 47.89% and 32.26%, respectively, and can produce 2.74 kg/h of hydrogen. The biomass fuel consumption rate within the system is 0.055 kg/s. The overall exergy destruction of the system amounts to 1240 kW, with the biomass boiler and the condenser being the components that experience the greatest exergy destruction, registering values of 535.5 kW and 432.3 kW, respectively.

	abstract = {Biorenewable hydrogen is requisite to replace non-renewable hydrogen. Decarbonization is assured. Hydrogen demand is severely rising due to mitigating climate change and reducing fossil fuel dependency. Green Hydrogen from agro waste proposition makes bio-circular economy upcycling. The main objective of this study is to reinforce the hope of renewable, sustainable H2 production from agro-waste. Initially, this paper shows the demand for green hydrogen, the sustainable availability of agro waste, and their capability to produce H2. Insights into the gasification of agro waste about cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin with conventional gasification. The effect of catalyst and supercritical gasification and their challenges is discussed. Most uniquely, other reviews highlight various aspirations behind agro-waste gasification to attain a strong business model, such as co-production, co-gasification, and CO2 reforming with H2 yield. This review exhibits some main insight into various aspects of agro-waste gasification. H2 from agrowaste gasification has high energy content (122 kJ/g) and high energy conversion efficiency in the range of 55–58 %, in addition to gaining the economic penalties of 2.2–2.5 net points for decarbonization. Agro waste is composed of lignocellulosic material that is relatively richer in hydrogen than fossil fuel resources. In SCWG, water is one of the natural solvents, which means feedstock effectively dissolves with water solvents. Intermittent density, low viscosity, and surface tension are nearly zero values due to SCW having no specific phase boundary, which enhances the gasification and substantially reduces tar formation during SCWG. Catalyst utilization enhances H2 production. The present study comprehensively exhibits the role of catalyst and their supporter and promoter. Ni-based catalysts are mostly suggested for H2 production but fall into reusability issues. The main reason behind this is that Ni is inefficient in removing HCl, H2S, and total trace elements during gasification. Recently, low-cost and waste-to-wealth transformation aspects of biochar-based catalysts have gained attention. Renewable-assisted gasification significantly improves the energy and exergy of the system and suppresses the important concern of energy consumption during gasification. Renewable assisted and various aspiration incorporation into gasification is solidly recommended for future implementation based on energy, economic, and environmental benefits from them. Plastic and biomass are richer in hydrocarbon and oxygen, respectively; this synergistic effect has the potential to enhance the H2 yield. From this study, PP plastic is mostly preferred for co-gasification with biomass. Compared to 100 wt% of biomass, the introduction of plastic slightly increased the coke formation, but the H2 yield was improved. When the plastic mixture of 10 wt% increases coke deposition, however, significant coke deposition is not reported when 20 wt% of plastic concentration is not reported. Carbon capture via CO2 inert gas supply enhances the H2 yield, provides a route to carbon trade, and substantially contributes to GHG pollution mitigation. Agro-waste gasification is produced by a product that has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications due to its unique properties, such as large specific surface area, porosity, functional groups, high reliability, and minimum cost. Hopefully, this review will be an optic to the most appropriate green hydrogen production path for sustainable clean energy production and effective agro-waste management. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The measures needed to limit global warming pose a particular challenge to current fossil fuel exporters, who must not only decarbonise their local energy systems, but also compensate for the expected decline in fossil fuel revenues. One possibility is seen in the export of green hydrogen. Using Algeria as a case study, this paper analyses how different levels of ambition in hydrogen exports, energy efficiency and fuel switching affect the cost-optimal expansion of the power sector for a given overall emissions reduction path. Despite falling costs for photovoltaics and wind turbines, the results indicate that in countries with very low natural gas prices, such as Algeria, a fully renewable electricity system by 2050 is unlikely without appropriate policy measures. The expansion of renewable energy should therefore start early, given the high annual growth rates required, which will be reinforced by additional green hydrogen exports. In parallel, energy efficiency is a key factor as it directly mitigates CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and reduces domestic electricity demand, which could instead be used for hydrogen production. Integrating electrolysers into the power system could potentially help to reduce specific costs through load shifting. Overall, it seems advisable to analyse hydrogen exports together with local decarbonisation in order to better understand their interactions and to reduce emissions as efficiently as possible. These results and the methodology could be transferred to other countries that want to become green hydrogen exporters in the future and are therefore a useful addition for researchers and policy makers. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Installing multi-renewable energy (RE) power plants at designated locations, known as RE parks, is a promising solution to address their intermittent power. This research focuses on optimizing RE parks for three scenarios: photovoltaic (PV)-only, wind-only, and hybrid PV-wind, with the aim of generating green hydrogen in locations with different RE potentials. To ensure rapid response to RE fluctuations, a Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyzer is employed. Furthermore, this research proposes detailed models for manufacturer-provided wind power curves, electrolyzer efficiency against its operating power, and electrolyzer cost towards its capacity. Two optimization cases are conducted in MATLAB, evaluating the optimum sizes of the plants in minimizing levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) using classical discrete combinatorial method and determining the ideal PV-to-wind capacity ratio for operating PEM electrolyzer within hybrid PV-wind parks using particle swarm optimization. Numerical simulations show that wind power-based hydrogen production is more cost-effective than PV-only RE parks. The lowest LCOH, $4.26/kg H2, and the highest LCOH, $14.378/kg H2, are obtained from wind-only and PV-only configurations, respectively. Both occurred in Adum-Kirkeby, Denmark, as it has highest average wind speed and lowest irradiance level. Notably, LCOH is reduced with the hybrid PV-wind configuration. The results suggest the optimum PV-to-wind capacity ratio is 65:35 on average and indicate that LCOH is more sensitive to electrolyzer's cost than to electricity tariff variation. This study highlights two important factors, i.e., selecting the suitable location based on the available RE resources and determining the optimum size ratio between the plants within the RE park. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The shift from fossil fuels to clean energy carriers, such as renewable H2, is imminent. Consequently, a global H2 market is taking shape, involving countries with limited or insufficient energy resources importing from renewable-rich countries. This study evaluates the techno-economics of renewable hydrogen (H2) export in a globally significant scenario in which Australia exports to Japan. To gain insight into the immediate, realisable future, the base year was selected as 2030, with a consequently small (in export terms) hydrogen production rate of 100 t/day landed capacity. Electricity was generated by photovoltaic arrays (PV) connected directly to proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser plant, allowing for flexible gaseous hydrogen (GH2) production. To enhance the fidelity of the technoeconomic model, we incorporated rarely applied but impactful parameters, including dynamic efficiency and the overload capacity of PEM electrolysers. The GH2 produced was assumed to be converted into condensed forms suitable for export by sea: liquid hydrogen (LH2), and the chemical carriers liquid ammonia (LNH3), methanol (MeOH), methylcyclohexane (MCH). These were assumed to be reconverted to GH2 at the destination. LNH3 and MCH emerged as promising carriers for export, yielding the lowest landed levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH). LH2 yielded the highest LCOH unless boiloff gas could be managed effectively and cheaply. A sensitivity analysis showed that a lower weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and scale-up can significantly reduce the landed LCOH. Increasing the production rate to 1000 t/day landed capacity very significantly lowered the landed LCOH, providing a strong incentive to scale up and optimise the entire supply chain as fast as possible. © 2024 The Authors},

One of the feasible solutions to the climatic issues currently in this region is using sustainable energy sources. Hydrogen is an alternative option to fossil resources generated from sustainable energy sources. It is a form of energy that is both ecologically safe and sustainable. Hydrogen may now be produced in several different ways, including by reforming hydrocarbons, the Electrolysis of water, and Steam reforming of fossil fuels. However, because there is a finite supply of fossil fuels and a change in climate conditions due to the emission of CO2 & other contaminants, there has been a focus on producing hydrogen using renewable resources. This study reviews an H2 production system that combines geothermal & solar energy, the two primary renewable energy sources and a hybrid solar-geothermal system. This study looked into different aspects, like the working fluid for water electrolysis, the geothermal fluid temperature, and the type of power cycle.

	abstract = {With the escalating severity of the global climate crisis and the strengthening global demand for carbon neutrality, hydrogen produced from renewable energy offers a pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality. To reduce the cost of eco-friendly hydrogen production, we need to increase the current density in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis for green hydrogen production, a promising technology. One problem arising from an increase in current density is that it leads to a significant generation of oxygen, resulting in mass transfer losses. However, there have been few studies on oxygen transport near the anode catalyst layer, with most studies only measuring current density. In this study, local static pressure and temperature were measured in real-time to elucidate the relationship between voltage and current. At 2.1 V (corrected voltage = 2.03 V), the static pressure amplitude is approximately −5 to 5 kPa. At 2.55 V (correction voltage = 2.41 V), it decreased by about 50 % to about −2.5 to 2.5 kPa, and the frequency became faster. With increasing voltage, the decrease in static pressure amplitude and the increase in frequency occur because oxygen rapidly increases in the catalyst layer, resulting in a reduction in residence time. At 1.65 V (corrected voltage = 1.63 V), there is little change in local static pressure, indicating the dominance of the liquid single phase. At 3.6 V (corrected voltage = 3.05 V), there is little change in local static pressure. This is due to the rapid detachment of oxygen bubbles, leading to the dominance of the gas single phase. This elucidates how oxygen bubbles are influenced by fluctuations in local static pressure, leading to the conclusion that efficient design patterns for future anode flow fields can be achieved. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In a scenario where curtailment is restrained (514.1 GWh/year), our findings unveil promising prospects: hydrogen and ammonia can be produced at levelized costs of 2.4 USD/kg and 600 USD/ton, respectively. More significantly, the integration of free energy (curtailed energy) and the synergistic utilization of oxygen and rare gases, notably argon, precipitate a remarkable cost reduction to 1.5 USD/kg and 401 USD/ton for hydrogen and ammonia production, respectively. This remarkable cost reduction underscores a substantial improvement, with the cost of ammonia being USD 219 lower than the average market price (USD 620). We advocate for the adoption of the hydrogen energy release optimizer and strategic utilization of by-products as pivotal strategies to significantly mitigate the costs associated with hydrogen and ammonia production, thereby amplifying the value and viability of renewable energy initiatives. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Popularization of renewable energy sources (RESs), driven by the goal of carbon footprint mitigation in urban areas, invites unprecedented uncertainties into power distribution networks (PDNs). The uncertainties stemming from intrinsic intermittency of the RESs force network planners to meet flexibility requirements. For handling this challenge, multiple energy storage systems have recently emerged as a pivotal component across the PDNs. In this sense, the authors of this current study present here a new urban-load density-dependent framework for multi-period distribution expansion planning (DEP) considering hybrid hydrogen/battery/wind/solar energy systems for both flexibility enhancement and transition toward low-carbon PDNs. The proposed framework, from a new perspective, aims to divide the PDNs into multiple zones, according to load density of different urban areas under two simultaneous incommensurable objective functions: (i) minimization of investment and operation and maintenance costs; and, (ii) maximization of the supply-demand-related flexibility (SDF) improvement metric minus network-related flexibility (NTF) degradation metric. As the resultant optimization problem formulation has a challenging non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear structure, a fuzzy-based symphony orchestra search algorithm (F-SOSA) was employed to determine the final optimal solution. The effectiveness of the newly developed framework was verified through simulation results on standard 54-node and realistic 95-node distribution test networks. The results illustrate that the integration of hydrogen/battery energy systems brought about an increase of 9.52% and a decrease of 14.96% for the SDF and NTF, respectively, in comparison to their absence. One can further stat that applying these multiple energy systems is associated with a reduction of 20.64% of the total investment cost. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen serves as an effective energy carrier for achieving sustainable development goals. However, the high production cost and intermittent renewable energy output cause obstacles to hydrogen production. Various electrolyzer control methods have been proposed to promote electrolyzers' efficiency. Traditional electrolyzer control methods may lead to significant differences in electrolyzer wear among large-scale hydrogen production systems. Hence, this paper proposes a multi-objective rolling strategy based on photovoltaic power forecasting to mitigate electrolyzer switch fluctuations, enhance hydrogen production efficiency, and better manage the electrolyzers. Initially, the trend of photovoltaic output is calculated based on the predicted values of the photovoltaic output from the particle swarm algorithm (PSO)-backpropagation (BP) model, and during the power ramp-up phase, some electrolyzers are activated in advance to expedite the cold start process and enhance the hydrogen production. Simultaneously, the electrolyzers' power distribution and operational status are adjusted in conjunction with the real-time power situation. Finally, a multi-objective rolling strategy is proposed to balance the operational indicators of the electrolyzers. The results indicate that the proposed method yields 4,952,642 Nm3 hydrogens over six months, which has increased by 5.37% and 9.00% compared to the simple start-stop and rotation strategy, respectively. Moreover, switch action times are reduced by 27.68% and 43.22%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in significantly enhancing hydrogen production and improving the economic feasibility of photovoltaic/hydrogen systems. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The hydrogen pressure typically increases to approximately 700-bar for storage in high-pressure tanks. Some industry applications use such a high-pressure hydrogen but some others need lower-pressure hydrogen where the pressure is reduced through pressure reduction valves. Some energy is lost during pressure reduction which would be significant in large-scale systems. A multi-level hydrogen storage can address this issue, where the hydrogen is stored at various pressures. This paper addresses an electricity-hydrogen nexus system integrated with multi-level hydrogen storage and solar PV sites. The designed system supplies electric and fuelcell vehicles at 3 different charging points including an electric vehicle charging station, fuelcell car refueling station, and fuelcell truck refueling station. The hydrogen is stored at 30, 350, and 700-bar pressure levels and each level feeds various users. The water electrolysis is employed to generate hydrogen at 30-bar pressure and 2 compressors increase the pressure to 350 and 700-bar. The cost function, defined as the daily energy cost, is optimized at $1045.65 per day. The water electrolyzer produces the most hydrogen during nighttime when electricity is inexpensive. Under normal operating conditions, the fuel cell is not utilized due to its low efficiency of about 60%. However, it serves as a backup resource in the event of a system outage, such as when the external grid fails, in hours 22 to 24. During this time, the fuel cell is activated and produces 154 kWh. © 2024},

	abstract = {Single hydrogen production methods cannot meet the stable hydrogen demand for many engineering applications under carbon emission requirements. This paper proposes a hydrogen energy hub (HEH) for stable and green hydrogen production from variable renewable energy inputs. The HEH integrates water electrolysis, biomass gasification, and natural gas reforming, which are coupled and coordinated with complementary utilization of both materials and energy. The uncertainties associated with biomass moisture content (MC) and photovoltaic (PV) generation for hydrogen production are considered. The impact of MC on the production rate of biomass is quantified and embedded in a thermodynamic equilibrium model, and inaccurate PV forecasts are also taken into account. A systematic model of HEH is developed to improve the economic benefit of system operation while providing probabilistic guarantees on the robustness of stable hydrogen production. A double-loop robust algorithm is adapted to efficiently solve the robust model, with the outer loop developing a day-ahead scheduling scheme and the inner loop figuring out the worst-case scenario. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through case studies in terms of cost reduction, decision robustness, and computational efficiency. A 9.9% improvement in energy efficiency can be achieved through complementary utilization. The robust optimization is able to achieve an average total cost reduction of 37.52% over the deterministic optimization in 1000 random scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study aims a techno-economic analysis of a plant that produces methanol by hydrogenating carbon dioxide in the waste gas from an oil refinery using the electricity from floating photovoltaic power plant. First, carbon dioxide in the flue gas is captured in the carbon capture plant (CCP), and the hydrogen obtained from the seawater in the hydrogen plant (HP) with the help of photovoltaic energy is combined in the methanol plant (MPP) to produce methanol fuel. Using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES), a calculation was made of the amount of energy required and the number of solar panels or wind turbines that would be required to meet this demand, and then the environmental impact of the methanol plant was investigated. The Libyan Az-Zawiya oil refinery was considered for the case study due to its high solar potential, proximity to the sea and energy security. Systems' processes for CO2 emissions, heat integration, energy efficiency, and thermo-economic performance were all taken into consideration. Renewable energy, synthetic fuel, and the methanol plant showed efficiencies of 0.21%, 0.5872%, and 0.1626%, respectively, and at the optimum density of the electrolyzer, 2.2 kA/m2, the efficiency of the electrolyzer was 0.782%. According to this study, all output parameters increase with the increase in the flue gas in the process, showing that flue gas is the most important input parameter affecting the outputs. The total cost of the plant for 30 years of operation was found to be $11.350 billion, with a production capacity of over 43.360 million tons of methanol, which equates to $412.9 per ton and $0.4129 per kg. Environmentally, the rate of captured emissions was about 4890 tons per day, and the mitigation rate was approximately 4513 tons per day. According to the results, the current plant is competitive with other clean synthetic fuel production plants. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A large community such as NEOM City which is supposed to be powered only by wind and solar renewable energy requires a significant amount of energy storage. Given the limitations of the current energy storage technologies, from the total storable energy to the time this energy is stored, from the cost to the technology readiness level, it is important to provide assessments of continuing evolving alternative technologies. The cases of electric (external) thermal energy storage (eTES), and hydrogen thermal energy storage (hTES), are here considered. eTES is based on warming up a molten salt by using an electric resistance. The molten salt is then used to warm up a power cycle fluid for dispatchable energy production running a thermal power cycle. eTES suffers from round trip efficiency below 50 % but may handle a larger amount of energy at a lower cost compared to lithium-ion battery energy storage. eTES may benefit from integration with concentrated solar power with (internal) thermal energy storage. hTES is then based on green hydrogen production by electrolyzers, storage of the hydrogen in tanks, and combustion of the hydrogen to warm up a power cycle fluid for dispatchable energy production running a thermal power cycle. Of cost more difficult to estimate, also depending on the deployment of electrolyzers and round trip efficiencies below 50 %, hTES has the benefit to permit the storage of any amount of energy even over long time scales such as those needed to compensate for seasonal variability. Before electrolyzers provide the due amount of green hydrogen, the combustion power plant can be run with natural gas, delivering if not zero CO2 emission, certainly the lowest life cycle CO2 emission for dispatchable electricity at present. Finally, eTES and hTES can be coupled with each other, and also integrated with waste-to-energy (WTE) systems, for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach based on common thermal power cycles. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

First, the potential of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) is assessed. A sensitivity analysis is also performed on the temporal resolution of the model to determine an adequate trade-off between the computation time and the accuracy of the results. Then, a techno-economic optimization scenario is carried out, resulting in a total net present cost of about 233.7 B€. A high penetration of VRES technologies is foreseen by 2050 with a total VRES installed capacity of 272.9 GW (mainly photovoltaic and onshore wind). Batteries are found to be the preferable energy storage solution in the first part of the energy transition, while the hydrogen storage starts to be convenient from about the year 2040. Indeed, the role of hydrogen storage becomes fundamental as the VRES penetration increases thanks to its cost-effective long-term storage capability.

We present a techno-economic model estimating AEMWE's baseline levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) at $5.79/kg, considering trade-offs between current density, efficiency, stability, capital, and operating costs. The optimal current density is 1.38 A cm−2, balancing stability and performance for the lowest LCOH. Using low-cost electricity and larger stack sizes, AEMWE could achieve $2/kg low-carbon hydrogen. Technical improvements targeting system efficiency, particularly reducing overpotentials in hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, could further reduce LCOH to $1.29/kg, approaching U.S. Department of Energy cost targets.

Significant water-splitting activity was achieved using urea and organic dye (methylene blue) as supporting electrolytes to avoid delayed OER kinetics. For the KOH + urea and KOH + organic dye electrolytes, the working electrode displays an overpotential of 1.37 V against RHE and 1.30 V vs RHE, respectively, to yield a current density of 10 mA/cm2. The CuCo2S4 working electrode exhibits an overpotential of 212 mV versus RHE and 158 mV vs RHE at 10 mA/cm2 current density while monitoring hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity. For the KOH + organic dye electrolyte, the electrode exhibits exceptionally efficient electrocatalytic water splitting, with an overpotential of 1.50 V at a current density of 10 mA/cm2. At high current densities, the CuCo2S4 working electrode shows exceptional stability at industry standards throughout a broad pH range of basic, acidic, neutral, and saline environments. The use of several supporting electrolytes demonstrates an overall water splitting that is energy-efficient. Wastewater treatment can be accomplished through a circular economy strategy by merging the goals of environmental remediation (dye degradation) and renewable energy production (hydrogen evolution). This approach promotes sustainable growth, reduces waste, and encourages resource recovery. According to the internationally endorsed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), treating wastewater has the potential to help achieve 11 of the 17 SDGs. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Aiming at a large number of decentralized resources such as rural biomass, rooftop photovoltaic, and decentralized wind power, a novel rural virtual power plant (VPP) has been conceptualized. The VPP is integrated by biomass waste conversion system (BWC), carbon to energy (C2P), demand response aggregator (DRA), and distributed renewable energy (DRE), namely, BDCD-VPP. Then, this paper proposes a data-driven two-stage robust optimization dispatching model for BDCD-VPP considering carbon-green certificates equivalent conversion mechanism. This model aims to address the uncertainty of wind power plants (WPP) and photovoltaic (PV) power generation. Strong duality theorem (SDT) and C&CG algorithm are applied to construct this model. Thirdly, the Aumann-Shapley method (A-S) was enhanced by incorporating risk factor, cost factor, and carbon reduction factor. This refinement results in the development of a synergistic scheduling revenue allocation method for electricity‑carbon-green certificates. Finally, the Lankao rural energy revolution pilot program in China is selected as the case study, the results showed: (1) The BDCD-VPP aggregates distributed energy sources such as the rural WPP and the PV to realize electricity‑carbon-electricity cycle effect. The BDCD-VPP generates a green certificate revenue of 47.17¥/MWh and exhibited carbon emissions of 0.37 t/MWh. The proposed Carbon-Green Certificates Equivalent Conversion Mechanism increases BDCD-VPP benefit ratio by 3.52%. (2) The proposed two-stage robust optimization dispatching model enhances the ability of BDCD-VPP to adapt to uncertainty. Compared to the day-ahead stage, biomass power generation (BPG) and waste power generation (WPG) increase upward peaking power by 24.05% and 9.99% in intra-day stage. Flue gas treatment system (FG-TS), gas-power plant carbon capture (GPPCC) and power to gas (P2G) increase downward peaking power by 65.15%, 70.99% and 25.94%. (3) Utilizing the proposed benefit allocation methodology, BPG and WPG need to concede 38.25¥/MWh and 65.02¥/MWh for carbon emissions associated with electricity. WPP and PV need to concede 64.25¥/MWh and 33.71¥/MWh for power generation uncertainty. GPPCC, P2G, DRA, and small hydropower station (SHS) obtain revenues of 24.48 ¥/MWh, 55.07 ¥/MWh, 70.38 ¥/MWh, and 51.30 ¥/MWh. Compared to the A-S, the proposed benefit allocation methodology exhibits 6.92% improvement in satisfaction. Overall, the proposed data-driven two-stage robust optimization dispatching model and benefit allocation strategy facilitates the optimal aggregation and utilization of rural distributed energy resources, considering the interests of various stakeholders. This is conducive to achieving a clean and low-carbon transformation of the overall energy structure. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The increasing deployment of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the power sector, such as wind and solar photovoltaic, is expected to reduce emissions. However, VRE poses challenges due to their intermittency and variability. The Future Renewable Energy Performance into the Power System Model (FEPPS) is used to analyse VRE penetration in Great Britain's (GB) power system, resulting in VRE shares of around 65%, far from over 80% forecasted by 2030 and 2040 due to flexibility and stability constraints. The incorporation of new power generation and energy storage technologies is also analysed, including the role of biomass and hydrogen as low-carbon fuel options. Hydrogen is assumed to be produced from the curtailment of VRE and biomass. Between 6.57 and 283 Mt. of biomass would be required to balance bio‑hydrogen requirements by 2040; therefore, hydrogen production would depend on technology prioritisation. Power generation from hydrogen technologies (fuel cells and turbines) has a significant role in power system decarbonisation, with hydrogen turbines meeting up to ∼10% of annual electricity demand. In contrast, generation from batteries, adiabatic compressed air energy storage and natural gas turbines is not significant. Moreover, between 7.7 and 9.7 TWh of hydrogen storage would be needed, and there is substantial potential for salt cavern storage in GB, providing many 100s TWh. Finally, incorporating new generation and storage technologies relies on levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) reductions of 31% and 13% by 2030 and 2040, respectively, to keep the power sector on track towards decarbonisation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

As of 2021, the kingdom recognizes a global hydrogen demand of 8 GW, with forecasts highlighting a skyrocketing growth to between 80 and 100 TW-hours by 2030. Despite aggressive initiatives to tap into renewable energy, notably solar, these might not suffice for the escalating green hydrogen demand. The integration of green hydrogen in Saudi Arabia energy matrix is intrinsically linked to the emergence of a robust hydrogen infrastructure. While current pipelines could facilitate gaseous hydrogen transport, the economic practicality of using tank ships for distant distribution is becoming crucial. Saudi Arabia is proactively establishing hydrogen alliances with countries that can produce green hydrogen economically, considering global political, business, and environmental dynamics. Energy production hubs aim to produce around 5 GW of hydrogen by 2025. However, the cost-effectiveness of storing hydrogen derived from solar power isn't expected to challenge batteries until approximately 2035. This research highlights green hydrogen crucial role in kingdom energy transformation, emphasizing the complex relationship between technology, policy, and global partnerships in determining its trajectory. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

To address the urgent need for energy transition, we conducted a system-level analysis to explore the economy of integrating renewable energy generation, hydrogen production, chemical conversion, storage, and distribution in a given region. First, we developed an optimization model that determines the optimal layout and operation of hydrogen-based renewable energy infrastructure with the temporal and geographical diversity of renewable energy, multiple energy conversion technologies, energy carrier options, and transportation routes. Second, we conducted a set of sensitivity analyses to explore the design and technological bottlenecks of the system to provide guidance for future development. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study of a renewable energy infrastructure in China. Results show that, with careful design, a hydrogen-based renewable energy infrastructure can fill the gaps of energy supply and demand across a wide geographical area. We have observed that the capital cost of the electrolyzer is the most significant, contributing to 20.8 % of the total cost of the infrastructure, followed by transmission costs (19.6 %). As a result, the economics of the system are most sensitive to the efficiency of the PEM. A 20 % increase in the electrolyzer's efficiency leads to a 10.2 % reduction in the total cost. The installation of wind turbines and solar panels is influenced by geographical features, with more than 80 % of the power generating capacity allocated in the northern regions of China. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This study investigates the potential and economics of hydrogen as a clean energy to satisfy the energy demand and reduce emissions. Heavy-duty vehicles and hydraulic fracking processes, which consume significant amounts of diesel are introduced as pilot markets for hydrogen. The technical, economic, and environmental aspects of both markets are provided. Then, a case study of the Permian Basin is rendered to show the effects of hydrogen in the region. In this study, the HDSAM model is used to obtain the cost of hydrogen. A function to predict the hydrogen demand for hydraulic fracking is provided based on real data. The results obtained in this study are as follows. First, the results for heavy-duty vehicles show that hydrogen demand is equal to 148 (tonnes/day), and hydrogen cost is 7.58 ($/kg). The refueling station is the major contributor to the hydrogen cost. Among refueling station components, compressor and storage induce significant costs. Liquid hydrogen is cheaper than gas hydrogen. Switching costs from diesel trucks to hydrogen trucks is equal to 0.65 ($/miles). If the payload and dwell time costs are considered, hydrogen trucks can even be cheaper than EV trucks. Second, the results for hydraulic fracking show that hydrogen demand is equal to 334 (tonnes/day) considering 1430 wells in the Permian Basin. The hydrogen cost is 4.22 ($/kg). If hydrogen is used instead of diesel in fracking, 3.41×106 kg CO2-eq as well as 4.10×107 kg of NOx can be saved from emissions. The hydrogen cost is equal to or even less than the diesel cost to generate 1 horsepower-hour for hydraulic fracking. This work can be expanded by investigating ammonia. Its features can be compared with hydrogen in terms of stability for long-term storage, transmission, and the globally established infrastructure.

	abstract = {The primary scope of the present work is the comprehensive investigation of a novel multigeneration system that exploits renewable energy sources, i.e. solar energy, geothermal energy, and biomass, and produces four useful outputs, i.e. electricity, heating, cooling, and green hydrogen. Solar irradiation is the primary energy source, which is exploited by parabolic trough collectors and powers a supercritical CO2 regenerative Brayton cycle, while a biomass boiler serves as an auxiliary energy input. In addition, the whole installation includes a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, a water heater, as well as an absorption chiller, where a geothermal well is used for heat rejection. Apart from the thermal energy storage tank, which is coupled with the collectors, hydrogen production is used as a secondary energy storage method, as the excess produced renewable electricity feeds the electrolyzer. Consequently, the installation is examined parametrically, and optimized on steady-state conditions. Then, a dynamic simulation study is conducted for the climate data of Athens, Greece. According to the results, at the optimum operation point on steady-state conditions, the energy efficiency is determined at 37.89%, and the exergy efficiency at 20.86%. Moreover, the annual energy and exergy efficiencies are defined at 32.52%, and 18.51%, respectively. The economic evaluation analysis indicates that the payback period is about 11 years, while the internal rate of return, and the net present value are determined at 10.62% and 7,753,905 €, respectively. In addition, the system is estimated to save 3072.6 tons of CO2 equivalent per annum. In conclusion, the proposed multigeneration system can address the various energy needs and recent environmental challenges, as a totally renewable, economically feasible, and environmentally friendly solution. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Australia is taking positive steps to increase its climate and clean energy ambitious targets through investment in the clean energy infrastructure and increased funding at federal and state levels. A systematic approach is required to propel the progress of environmentally friendly hydrogen production and to achieve these objectives, a techno-economic optimization analysis for hydrogen generation to use the findings to improve the efficiency of recharging fuel cell vehicles is performed. The results of the evaluation and optimization showed that the energy system which integrates wind-based sources with photovoltaic sources, presents the most advantageous metrics. The lowest values for the selected energy system include the Net Present Cost of $614,957, the Levelized Cost of Energy of $0.4347/kWh, and the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen of $0. 375/kg. More so, the cost of energy is expected to decrease further as the lifetime of the electrolyzer lifetime increases as supported by sensitivity analysis. The study showed that setting up a refueling station in the city of Geelong has the potential to serve as a viable solution for decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and achieving decarbonization within Geelong's transportation sector.

The methodology includes process modelling, biomass and infrastructure mapping, technoeconomic analysis and greenhouse gas impact assessment and is implemented having Denmark as case study. Three supply-chains were evaluated for the upgrading of the biofuel which are chemical stabilizing, on-site hydrotreating, and centralised hydrotreating. The two feedstocks assessed were imported forestry and domestic agricultural residue resulting in a total of six different implementation scenarios. The results for the case study indicate that for forestry residue the proximity to an industrial port is the most dominating factor when determining feasible site locations. The performance in the agricultural residue scenarios is more impacted by infrastructure parameters. In the on-site hydrotreating scenario the best performing locations are found close to the hydrogen line to reduce connection expenses.

	abstract = {The increase of the electricity production from non-programmable and intermittent Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) generates criticalities in the balance between the energy supply and demand, requiring significant energy storage capabilities for the next future. The exploitation of the available NG Transmission Network (NGTN) by implementing the Power to Gas (PtG) technology is particularly promising since it allows a massive energy storage capability and the decarbonization of the NGTN by green hydrogen injection into the grid with growing percentages up to 100%. The objective of this work is to analyse the actual feasibility of distributed green hydrogen generation and its injection into the national NGTN. A mathematical model has been developed to assess the dynamic operation of a PtH2 integrated system to produce green hydrogen using photovoltaic-powered electrolysers and to inject it into the NGTN upstream of a Regulating and Measuring Station (RMS) located in central Italy. Three different surface sizes are considered for the installation of PV panels (100 m2, 300 m2 and 500 m2) and the optimal hydrogen accumulation size has been calculated in order to ensure the uniformity of the supplied mixture throughout the year. Obtained results show that employing the optimal accumulation size, hydrogen percentage in the NG-H2 mixture ranges between 0% and 0.90% by volume. In the best-case scenario (i.e., when considering a surface area of 500 m2), the cost of hydrogen production is 5.10 EUR/kg H2 and the PtH2 plant allows to save 32.348 tonnes of CO2 emissions every year. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this regard, the proposed plant comprises of biomass gasification unit, photovoltaic thermal collectors, a proton exchange membrane hydrogen production unit, as well as a reverse osmosis water purification plant. The plant is named as (biomass-fired combined cycle with photovoltaic, thermal collectors, hydrogen production, and reverse osmosis) BCPVHR and to assess its performance, energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and environmental analyses are performed. The varying parameters are compressor pressure ratio and gas turbine inlet temperature. These two parameters' impact on energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, net generated power, fresh water production, total unit product cost as well and environmental index are assessed. The results are useful for adjusting the compressor pressure ratio and gas turbine inlet temperature. Please note that this plant is designed to be used completely or partially in sports facilities and can be a valuable endeavor for managing sports facilities to use renewable energy in their construction. Meanwhile, based on the priories of products different values of parameters can be used. Increasing the compressor pressure ratio raises the total unit product cost and the environmental index until 11.5 decreases and later increases. Increasing the gas turbine inlet temperature decreases the both total unit product cost and environmental index which reach 65 $/GJ and 65 kg/kWh, respectively. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel off-grid hybrid renewable energy system integrated with hydrogen production and retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries for combined power and heat supply to a small rural community. The system consists of photovoltaic (PV) panels, evacuated tube solar collectors, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), an alkaline electrolyzer, compressed hydrogen storage tanks, and reused lithium-ion batteries from EVs. A new battery model is developed in the Transient System Simulation Program (TRNSYS) to capture the capacity degradation of retired batteries. A two-stage energy management strategy is proposed to regulate power flow and maximize solar energy utilization. The system is optimized for minimum power supply disruption, hot water supply disruption, energy waste, and annualized costs over a 20-year lifetime using a multi-objective NSGA-II algorithm coupling MATLAB and TRNSYS. Optimization results reveal tradeoffs between the competing objectives. Dynamic simulations show the water tank temperature fluctuates between 20 and 100 °C with mean values dropping slightly in later years due to battery degradation. Energy waste from components rises in later years for the same reason. The replacement interval for a retired EV battery module is around 2.5 years. The integrated system proves feasible for off-grid combined power and heat supply using solar energy and retired EV batteries as storage, though battery degradation impacts long-term performance. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Aggregating a waste gasification unit with renewable energy sources (RES) into a virtual power plant (VPP) not only effectively reduces the negative impacts of renewable energy sources and improves the performance of VPP in the electricity market, but also participates in the hydrogen market by purifying the hydrogen in the syngas produced after gasification. A market bidding strategy that improves the profitability of the system is the basis for sustainable VPP. Based on this, this paper for the first time aggregates a waste gasification unit with RES into a VPP named WtE-VPP. Then, considering that the WtE-VPP system can generate both electricity and hydrogen and their outputs affect each other, this paper constructs a bi-level bidding strategy model for the combined electricity‑hydrogen market. The lower-level model aims to minimize the total social costs of the electricity and hydrogen markets, while the upper-level model aims to maximize the profits of WtE-VPP. Finally, the model is tested on an improved PJM 5-node grid with a 7-node hydrogen network, and the results show that the method is effective in reflecting strategic behaviors of WtE-VPP. Compared to participation in a single electricity market, the total benefits of WtE-VPP participation in both electricity and hydrogen markets increase by 39.18%. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study focuses on investigating the potential of methane pyrolysis process for low-carbon, low-cost hydrogen production when compared to alternative hydrogen production technologies. The design, techno-economic analysis, and GHG emission assessment of two different methane pyrolysis configurations, molten metal-based and thermal plasma-based, are conducted. In addition, to assess the effect of heat sources on both environmental and economic aspects of methane pyrolysis, three heating options are considered for the molten metal-based process: a gas-fired heater, a hydrogen-fired heater, and an electrical heater. Results are then compared against other hydrogen production technologies, including electrolysis, SMR without CCS, SMR with CCS, and biomass gasification. The data required for techno-economic analysis and assessing GHG emissions is obtained from Aspen Plus® process simulation models and U.S. DOE's H2A Production Models. Our results indicate that the H2 minimum selling price associated with pyrolysis systems are almost always lower than that for SMR with CCS considering a natural gas price of $6/GJ, an electricity price of $0.06/kWh, and a carbon black price of $200/t. However, to achieve a H2 minimum selling price lower than that of SMR without CCS, a carbon black price higher than $500/t is required. Furthermore, the impact of the carbon intensity of the electricity grid and natural gas supply chain for different geographical locations are evaluated. For instance, the results for British Columbia revealed that the GHG emissions of the methane pyrolysis fall within the range of 0.76 and 2.58 kg CO2 eq./kg H2 and can be as low as 50% of that of the SMR with CCS for molten metal-H2 fired configuration. The highest GHG emissions are encountered in the SMR and electrolysis pathways. These analyses show the potential of methane pyrolysis in achieving both lower H2 minimum selling price and GHG emissions, especially when considering solid carbon as a marketable co-product. © 2024},

As a consequence, a substantial expansion in hydrogen production, due to rise in the demand, is expected by 2050, with all the generation coming from zero-carbon processes (electrolysis/thermochemical cycles using clean electricity and heat) or from a low-carbon production process using steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage. Nuclear energy can be capitalized on both electricity and heat to provide a clean and reliable source of hydrogen through various processes. There are currently various demonstration projects undergoing in several countries to showcase the use of nuclear energy to produce clean hydrogen, considering both the current reactor fleet and advanced reactors. This paper provides an overview of these projects, giving an insight on the potential use of nuclear energy for hydrogen production and the current status of existing projects.

This paper contributes to understanding this transformation. This paper provides an overview of energy- and emission-intensive industry sectors with great potential to defossilize their production processes with hydrogen. An assessment of future hydrogen demand for various defossilization strategies in Germany that rely on hydrogen as a feedstock or as an energy carrier to a different extent in the sectors steel, chemicals, cement, lime, glass, as well as pulp and paper is carried out. Results indicate that aggregate industrial hydrogen demand in those industries would range between 197 TWh and 298 TWh if production did not relocate abroad for any industry sector. The range for hydrogen demand is mainly due to differences in the extent of hydrogen utilization as compared to alternative transformation paths for example based on electrification. The attractiveness of production abroad is then assessed based on the prospective comparative cost advantage of relocating parts of the value chain to excellent production sites for low-carbon hydrogen. Case studies are provided for the steel industry, as well as the chemical industry with ethylene production through methanol and the production of urea on the basis of ammonia. The energy cost of the respective value chains in Germany is then compared to the case of value chains partly located in regions with excellent conditions for renewable energies and hydrogen production. The results illustrate, that at least for some processes – as ammonia production – relocation to those favorable regions may occur due to substantial comparative cost advantages. © 2023},

	abstract = {As global energy consumption is rapidly climbing to maximum, fossil fuel resources face depletion on a global scale. The rapid depletion and higher energy demand consequences an escalation of energy prices originating from conventional sources as well as the release of greenhouse gases into the environment. Hydrogen as an alternative energy source merged as an ideal candidate, distinguished by its remarkable attributes and manifold advantages. It has an exceptional energy density of 120 MJ/kg and encompasses non-toxicity, sustainability, and a favorable environmental profile. Renewable and non-renewable sources can produce hydrogen and have versatile applications in transportation, power generation via fuel cells, and other industrial processes. Beyond having these advantages hydrogen has the benefits of energy security and can be produced locally. Nevertheless, commercial hydrogen has exceptionally low volumetric density under standard conditions which is the major obstacle in the way of its development. To cater this issue and to enhance its economic feasibility, two well-established methodologies are used by alterations in temperature and/or pressure conditions which facilitate the storage of hydrogen either in a pressurized gas or a cryogenic liquid. However, both methods incur energy consumption and pose safety concerns and complexity in the system, which raises the question of having other storage solutions. An emerging technology based on Solid-state hydrogen storage systems has recently gained substantial attention because of its high storage capacity and relatively mild temperature and pressure requirements. However, this technology is not yet mature enough because it doesn't fulfil the requirements to be implemented for industrial applications. But, intensive research in this field is underway to develop novel materials with enhanced performance at both the material and the system level. The current review report is focused on a comprehensive and in-depth comparative analysis of various hydrogen storage methods, with a major focus on the enhancement of the performance of the material which is suitable for solid-state hydrogen storage applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) microreactor systems offer the flexibility to efficiently utilize CO2 and renewable H2 for syngas production. However, the inherent fluctuation in the green H2 supply presents a substantial obstacle for cost-effective production, particularly at larger scales. In this work, the design and operation of RWGS microreactor systems with fluctuating H2 feed are addressed by multi-objective stochastic optimization. The optimization objectives are the reaction performance, the annual total cost, and the carbon footprint of the microreactor system, while the decision variables include the channel geometry, channel topology, and inter-stack flow controller configuration. The results demonstrate that a well-designed hierarchical microreactor system achieves excellent reaction performance even without inter-stack flow controllers under both deterministic and uncertain conditions. Small plate-level distribution channels and moderate-sized higher-level distribution channels allow good and stable reaction performance. To balance all the design objectives, it is suggested to first increase the number of stacks at smaller production scales and then increase the number of substrates within each stack at larger production scales. Our study provides new design insights for distributed production using modular devices under high penetration of renewable energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the quest for sustainable and clean energy solutions, and its effect on smart home energy management is of particular interest. With the rapid advancements in smart home technologies, energy optimization has become essential, aiming to achieve efficient energy consumption, cost reduction, and enhanced user comfort. Green hydrogen, produced through the electrolysis of water using renewable energy sources, emerges as a promising solution for sustainable energy. It offers numerous benefits, including zero greenhouse gas emissions, high energy density, and versatile applications. In the context of this study, the enhanced northern goshawk optimization (ENGO) algorithm and the original northern goshawk optimization (NGO) algorithm are investigated for optimizing smart home energy management. By employing a two-stage approach based on high and low-velocity ratios, ENGO overcomes the limitations of NGO, such as low exploitation capability and being trapped in local optima. The study demonstrates that ENGO outperforms NGO in achieving multiple objectives simultaneously, including reducing the peak-to-average ratio (PAR), lowering electricity costs, and ensuring user comfort. Furthermore, ENGO proves to be more robust, capable of handling complex smart home energy management problems with multiple constraints. Thus, the integration of hydrogen solutions, such as green hydrogen, with advanced optimization techniques like ENGO, can significantly contribute to the effective management of energy resources in smart homes, promoting sustainability and user satisfaction. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This paper investigates the planning and optimization of operations for an electricity-hydrogen integrated energy system (EH-IES), considering degradation and multi-timescale operations of storage devices to minimize the life cycle costs. To mitigate computational challenges, the planning model adopts a Representative Time Period (RTP) framework, and a novel intertemporal operation model is developed to coordinate the operations of battery and hydrogen storage. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage approach to derive representative weeks and hours from meteorological and load data using fewer data points, ensuring chronological coherence and preserving long-term patterns to validate storage device constraints and improve planning accuracy. Case studies in southeastern China's IES verify the effectiveness of our planning approach, which lowers equivalent annual costs by 4.5% and reduces battery capacity needs by 12.8%, thereby highlighting its significant economic benefits. Additionally, numerical analyses reveal that our two-stage method surpasses conventional RTP selection techniques, delivering at least 10% less average error with an equal number of operating points. © 2024},

	abstract = {Biological dihydrogen (H2) production is a promising alternative to the conventional non-renewable energies. H2 production by dark fermentation is particularly studied regarding its independence from fossil fuel and electricity, its cultivation into bioreactors and the broad range of substrate that can be used. A major goal application of dark fermentation is the valuation of wastes. In this context, cheese whey wastes are particularly adapted, since rich in organic matter, abundant and low cost. A novel H2-producing strain was isolated from a sample of mixed bovine manure and cheese whey, collected in a cheese-producing dairy farm. The strain was identified as a Clostridium beijerinckii strain based on morphological and physiological characteristics, and 16S rDNA sequencing. The optimum temperature and pH for H2 production was 40 °C and pH 7, respectively. Substrate and stress tolerance tests showed that C. beijerinckii C.sp.1.3 could produce H2 from glucose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose, galacturonic acid, xylose, and sucrose, and to a lesser extent from starch, cellulose and glycerol. The H2 production potential from a mix of dairy industrial wastes of this strain has been evaluated. The highest productivity in batch for 5 g L−1 of Total Organic Carbon (TOC) was 833.1 mL H2 L−1 d−1, with a yield of 2.03 mMH2 mMlactose−1, demonstrating the potential of this strain for H2 production from industrial wastes. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The number of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) in circulation has undergone a significant increase in recent years. This trend is foreseen to be stronger in the near future. In correlation with the FCEVs market increase, the hydrogen delivery infrastructure must be developed. With this aim, many countries have announced ambitious projects. For example, Spain has the objective of increasing the number of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS) with public access from three units in operation currently to about 150 by 2030. HRSs are complex systems with high variability in terms of layout design, size of components, operational strategy, hydrogen generation method or hydrogen generation location. This paper is focused on on-site HRS with electrolysis-based hydrogen production, which provides interesting advantages when renewable energy is utilized compared to off-site hydrogen production despite their complexity. To optimize HRS design and operation, a simulation model must be implemented. This paper describes a generic on-site HRS with electrolysis-based hydrogen production, a cascaded multi-tank storage system with multiple compressors, renewable energy sources, and multiple types of dispensing formats. A modelling approach of the layout is presented and tested with real-based parameters of an HRS currently under development, which is capable of producing 11.34 kg/h of green H2 with irradiation at 1000 W/m2. For the operation, an operational strategy is proposed. The modelled system is tested through several simulations. A sensitivity analysis of the effects of hydrogen demand and day-ahead hydrogen production objective on emissions, demand satisfaction and variable costs is performed. Simulation results show how the operational strategy has achieved service up to 310 FCEVs refuelling events of heavy duty and light duty FCEVs, bringing the total H2 sold up to almost 7200 H2kg in one month of winter. Additionally, considering variable costs of the energy from the utility grid, the model shows a profit in the range of 21–50 k€ for a daily demand of 60 H2kg/day and 100 H2kg/day, respectively. In terms of emissions, a year simulation with 60 H2kg/day of demand shows specific emissions in the production of H2 in Spain of 6.26 kgCO2eq/H2kg, which represents a greenhouse gas emission intensity of 52.26 gCO2eq/H2MJ. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the economic potentials of power and hydrogen generation via solar and wind energy resources at locations in Northern Germany and California, both of these (geographical) regions being pioneers in terms of a sustainable energy transition. Based on extensive research and electrolyzer manufacturer interviews, green hydrogen generation plants are modeled in a MATLAB® environment. All relevant inputs and outputs of the systems studied (wind power plants, photovoltaic power plants, and polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers, among others) are considered for different locations and framework conditions. In contrast to the existing literature, special attention is paid to the part-load behavior of electrolysis systems, which becomes particularly relevant in their interplay with volatile renewables. Metrics such as the levelized costs of electricity (LCOE) of the wind and photovoltaic power plants and the resulting levelized costs of hydrogen (LCOHy) are determined. With the help of the developed model, dimensioning of a whole system's components can be determined for different locations. A case study is conducted for a Northern German site and another one for a site in the Californian Mojave Desert. Both the optimal dimensioning of the renewable energy plants and the ratio of installed wind and photovoltaic power plant capacity are strongly location-dependent. In Northern Germany, for example, lower LCOHy can be generated at higher wind power plant capacity shares and, in the Mojave Desert, be produced at higher photovoltaic power plant capacity shares. In general, with larger plants and correspondingly larger polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers, LCOHy are lower due to scaling effects. Following this dimensioning recommendation, the LCOHy vary between 4.5 €/kg and 5.2 €/kg in the Northern German case study and between 4.6 US$/kg and 5.3 US$/kg in the Californian one. With costs of 1–2 €/kg, gray hydrogen is still economically superior. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The Republic of Korea intends to establish a nationwide hydrogen supply chain (HSC) infrastructure to promote the adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. As the hydrogen demand for mobility may be higher than the estimated production capacity of existing facilities, additional on-site hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) are required. To address infrastructure deployment problems, a two-stage (demand and supply stages) optimization approach is proposed based on mixed-integer linear programming models. The maximal covering location and p-median models at the demand stage determine the location and chargers of the HRSs and the demand allocation to the stations. At the supply stage, the supply model determines the installation of additional on-site production facilities for the deployed HRSs and the supply allocation to the stations by minimizing the installation and transportation costs. We estimated high-resolution demand data using public sources and utilized investigated supply data from reputable institutions representing the hydrogen economy in the Republic of Korea. The proposed approach provides realistic HSC infrastructure deployment plans, satisfying over 90% of the hydrogen demand in the years 2025 and 2030. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis indicated the effects of various parameters on the deployment plan, including the demand coverage and the need for additional on-site HRSs to address potential hydrogen supply shortages. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this paper, an integrated biogas power generation system with solid oxide fuel cells is proposed, which mainly consists of four units: a solar thermal energy storage unit, a biogas production and hydrogen generation unit, a SOFC-MGT unit, and a waste heat utilization unit. The presented system is first studied using energy, exergy, economic, and life cycle environmental analyses and the survey results are contrasted with those of renewable energy systems discussed in the references. Besides, a parametric study is conducted to explore the effect of thermodynamic parameters of solar irradiance, ambient temperature, work fluid temperature, reforming temperature, inlet H2O/CH4 ratio of the reformer, and the current density of SOFC. Results indicate that the proposed system's energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, electric power output and exergy destruction are 43.29%, 37.4%, 414.16 kW (net power generation is 351.43 kW) and 1434.59 kW, respectivily. Moreover, the system's levelized cost of electricity and carbon emission factor are $0.076/kWh and 335.6gCO2eq/kWh, having good economic and environmental benefits simultaneously. The parametric study shows that PTSC can be designed shorter with more solar irradiance and high ambient temperature. Besides, the increase of inlet H2O/CH4 ratio and reforming temperature make the system's energy efficiency fall by 2.5% and 20%. For every 300 A/m2 increase in the current density of SOFC, the system efficiency rises by 1.01%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

An optimization procedure is implemented in TRNSYS to design the main components in the system while minimizing either the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH2) or the primary energy needs. Green hydrogen production appears as a viable solution to decarbonize the industrial sector, with a predicted cost ranging from 10 to 11.5 USD/kg in case of 40% and 100% renewable energy source, respectively. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Ammonia as a carbon-free renewable energy is considered alternative energy used in vehicles, however, its application on WRE is lacking. Therefore, the present work aims to investigate the performance of ammonia-enriched hydrogen-fueled WRE to analyze the feasibility of ammonia applied in hydrogen-fueled WRE. The main conclusions are as follows: Under test conditions, the maximum brake torque and thermal efficiency are obtained at about 30% and 40% volume fraction of ammonia in fuel, and compared with pure hydrogen conditions, achieving relative improvements of 21% and 29%, respectively. Slightly rich combustion is recommended to increase power and decrease NO emissions with an acceptable economic loss.

	abstract = {The escalating effects of climate change and the finite nature of fossil fuels underscore the imperative for transitioning to renewable energy. This study assesses the feasibility of hybrid energy systems that harness renewable sources, such as solar and wind power, alongside hydrogen technologies and solid-state lithium-ion batteries in diverse energy landscapes. Concentrating on five of Australia's renewable energy zones (REZs)—Broken Hill in New South Wales, Murray River in Victoria, Darling Downs in Queensland, Riverland in South Australia, and North East Tasmania—the research employs the Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER Pro) microgrid software. This software optimizes the sizing of system components to ascertain the most cost-effective configurations for each REZ, considering varied scenarios, including resource availability and demand patterns. The findings indicate that Broken Hill and Murray River exhibit the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for off-grid and on-grid configurations, respectively, at $0.32/kWh and $0.030/kWh. Conversely, North East Tasmania has the highest LCOE for both configurations, at $0.38/kWh and $0.034/kWh, respectively. Furthermore, the study suggests that beyond grid extension distances of 350–530 km, off-grid solutions may be more economically viable than grid extensions. Moreover, on-grid configurations demonstrate the lowest net present cost (NPC), benefiting from the option to sell surplus electricity back to the utility grid, thereby enhancing their economic advantage over off-grid options. The strategic implications of these results are significant for global energy planning, advocating for a portfolio approach that incorporates a mix of on-grid, off-grid, and extended-grid systems, crucial for sustainably meeting future energy demands. These insights have the potential to guide research, policy, and investment decisions, promoting the cost-efficient deployment of renewable hydrogen hybrid energy systems. The outcomes of this study reinforce that a sustainable energy economy is necessary and achievable through the informed and strategic deployment of technology tailored to geographical and economic specificities. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This study aimed to find a distributed renewable power system with hydrogen generation and storage to meet the current Isle of Rum's energy demands. Five different systems (Case 2–6) were evaluated compared to the current power system (Case 1), with the inclusion of a hydrogen generation and storage subsystem acting as an energy storage medium in Case 3, 4, 5 and 6. Case 2 exhibited a 96.2% reduction in diesel consumption. Case 3 and 4 achieved a fully renewable generation mix through the addition of a hydrogen subsystem comprised of a 28 kW PEM electrolyser, 120 kg compressed storage and modified gen-set. Case 5 and 6 also achieved a fully renewable generation mix, meeting the domestic heating and full heating demands of the island respectively through the integration of heat pumps. Economic analysis showed that Case 2 exhibited the lowest cost, with a LCOE of £3.02/kWh, a 43% reduction from Case 1. Both Case 3 and Case 4 also had a lower LCOE than Case 1 of £5.02/kWh and £4.37/kWh respectively. This shows that the hydrogen subsystem designed can be an economically viable option despite its currently high CAPEX. Both Case 5 and 6 had the highest CAPEX of all systems, due to the additional generation technology required to meet the additional heating demand. However, they achieved the lowest LCOE at £1.86/kWh and £0.76/kWh, due to the high efficiency exhibited by the heat pumps used for the heating load. © 2023 The Authors},

By developing the large-scale hydrogen production by alkaline water electrolysis as the energy buffering, the consuming pressure of the power system caused by the growing penetration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy can be relieved effectively. However, when the alkaline water electrolysis is integrated with renewable energy sources, the unclear underlying mechanism and interaction characteristics limit large-scale application for hydrogen production.

	abstract = {Future power systems, in which generation will come almost entirely from variable Renewable Energy Sources (vRES), will be characterized by weather-driven supply and flexible demand. In a simulation of the future Dutch power system, we analyze whether there are sufficient incentives for market-driven investors to provide a sufficient level of security of supply, considering the profit-seeking and myopic behavior of investors. We co-simulate two agent-based models (ABM), one for generation expansion and one for the operational time scale. The results suggest that in a system with a high share of vRES and flexibility, prices will be set predominantly by the demand's willingness to pay, particularly by the opportunity cost of flexible hydrogen electrolyzers. The demand for electric heating could double the price of electricity in winter, compared to summer, and in years with low vRES could cause shortages. Simulations with stochastic weather profiles increase the year-to-year variability of cost recovery by more than threefold and the year-to-year price variability by more than tenfold compared to a scenario with no weather uncertainty. Dispatchable technologies have the most volatile annual returns due to high scarcity rents during years of low vRES production and diminished returns during years with high vRES production. We conclude that in a highly renewable EOM, investors would not have sufficient incentives to ensure the reliability of the system. If they invested in such a way to ensure that demand could be met in a year with the lowest vRES yield, they would not recover their fixed costs in the majority of years. © 2024 Delft University of Technology},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage in porous media (UHSP), typically employing depleted natural gas reservoirs, is being increasingly contemplated as a potentially viable energy storage option to compensate for intermittent renewable energy sources. A layer of cushion gas (typically N2, CH4 or CO2) is proposed to be accommodated in such UHSP systems to allow for pressure and volume control during hydrogen (the so-called working gas) injection and withdrawal, while also serving as a barrier to prevent excess water contamination. One significant challenge in such UHSP systems is the potential mixing between this working gas (hydrogen) and the cushion gas within the relevant reservoir. Such mixing increases the risk of unacceptable extracted hydrogen contamination (with the cushion gas), often requiring expensive surface hydrogen purification processes. Therefore, the use of a cushion gas has potential economic implications. Accurate determination of the extent of this mixing requires reservoir simulations, which depend on dispersion coefficient (KL) data as input. Such data are however not available in the literature for hydrogen under relevant reservoir conditions. Here we present novel measurements of KL for the dispersion of hydrogen in the three prospective cushion gases as a function of system pressure (50–100 bar) and for displacement velocities ranging from 0.2 to 8.4 cm/min. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper explores the use of Solar Chimney Power Plants (SCPPs) for the production of green hydrogen as a means to store excess electrical energy generated from renewable energy resources (RESs). The proposed structure produces electrical energy and distilled water by heating the air under the SCPP. The electrolyzer is integrated into the seawater pool and installed at the solar chimney's base. The weather conditions at the proposed location of the SCPP including solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, are analyzed to assess their impact on the performance of the SCPP. The potential applications and economic feasibility of the SCPP are discussed, considering its contribution to renewable energy generation and the benefits of hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. The results show that solar radiation levels and favorable temperature profiles play an important role in the performance of the SCPP. The SCPP could produce 380,263 kW h of electrical energy and 139,443 tons of distilled water annually. The results also showed that the SCPP could produce 13,000 kg of green hydrogen and 173,224 kg of oxygen annually. The revenue generated from the production of H2 and O2 has improved the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the SCPP to 0.51 $/kWh and made it compete with other energy production facilities. Monthly variations in electrical energy, H2, O2, and distilled water production, highlight the dependence of hydrogen production on solar intensity and temperature. Overall, the research demonstrates the potential of SCPPs and hydrogen production as a sustainable and efficient solution for storing and utilizing excess renewable energy. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Renewable hydrogen is emerging as a valid energy alternative to the fossil fuels currently in use. Governments are developing hydrogen-based energy strategies as a tool to decarbonise the transport, industrial, energy, and residential sectors. It is estimated that by 2050, hydrogen could cover 34% of the energy demand in these sectors in Europe according to the European Commission. However, for this to happen, green hydrogen must be produced on a large scale and in an economically feasible way. The aim of this project is to model any given renewable electricity generation system so that resources are optimized to achieve the highest and most cost-effective hydrogen production possible. Based on the green energy available data available and the characteristics of the electrolysers considered, the model minimises the cost per kilogram of hydrogen produced by optimising the size of the electrolyser. Once boundary conditions were set for two renewable energy generation cases and hydrogen production was determined for an average year, the profitability was calculated as a function of two variables: electrolysis plant size and hydrogen selling price. In the case of offshore wind power, it becomes profitable to produce hydrogen starting at a selling price of $5.5/kg H2, with a minimum plant size of 55 MW. With solar photovoltaic electricity as the input of the electrolysis plant in the second scenario, for plant size range of 1 MW–300 MW, the economic balance becomes positive selling at $3.5 to $7 per kg of hydrogen produced.

This paper presents a novel HRS with significantly lower energy consumption, based on a step-by-step compression strategy enabled by a highly-efficient 50-MPa LH2 pump for low-pressure compression and a subsequent thermal compression module for high-pressure compression driven by thermal energy. The performance of the cryogenic pressure vessels in the HRS process is analyzed via a numerical model, and then several improvements to the HRS process are proposed for large-scale refueling requirements. Finally, the techno-economic performance of the HRS is compared with the conventional HRSs and the HRS with pure thermal compression. Compared to the conventional HRSs with 90-MPa LH2 pumps, the capital cost of the proposed 400-kg/day HRS is reduced to $1.52M from $1.80M, while its energy consumption is reduced to 0.3 kWh/kgH2 from 1.3 kWh/kgH2.

	abstract = {Countries worldwide are seeking to decarbonize the planet by 2050 to mitigate climate change. Green hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis is vital to worldwide decarbonization. Consequently, electrolysis-based green H2 production for large-scale renewable energy power plants and other industrial and transportation applications has grown in popularity. The main objective of this work was to provide a recent review and evaluation of water electrolysis for green H2 production. In this review, the water electrolysis process, which involves the electrochemical water splitting and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting and their techno-commercial prospects including H2 production cost, along with recent developments in electrode and photoelectrode materials, and their environmental aspects for green H2 production were summarized. The results showed that the Ni-based catalyst improved the electrocatalytic activity at a current density of 10 mA/cm2, while TiO2-based catalysts enhanced PEC water-splitting processes with superior solar to H2 (STH) efficiency (3.7–16.9%). The levelized cost of H2 (LCOH) for PEC and polymer exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis is almost similar about 9 $/kgH2, and combining water electrolysis with wind and solar energy decreases the LCOH, which surpassed coal power generation by 40%. According to the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA), global warming potential (GWP) is the environmental effect category that causes the most concern and is the subject of the most research. The PEC-based water splitting process is the most environmentally friendly H2 production method since it emits the lowest GWP per kg of produced H2 (1.0 kg CO2/Kg H2) in comparison to wind-based PEM water electrolysis (4.0 kg CO2/Kg H2) and PV-solar-based PEM water electrolysis (1.5 kg CO2/Kg H2). Interestingly, the case studies in various countries related to the green H2 were also discussed. Finally, the future of green H2 production and the challenges it faces in achieving cost-effective commercial applications were discussed. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This study developed a novel assessment framework to analyze long-term energy transition in the road transport sector in which various technology options, market shares, policy measures, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions are considered in a single framework analysis. A data-intensive model was developed with the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) and used to analyze policy scenarios up to 2050 for Alberta, Canada, a hydrocarbon-rich province with an emission-intensive energy sector. Three key policy measures – carbon pricing, zero-emission vehicle sales mandate, and incentivization – were analyzed in nine individual and combined policy scenarios. The transition to both hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles was assessed for all vehicle categories. Each fuel's full energy supply chain was modelled, including resource extraction, conversion, transmission and distribution, and fuelling, allowing for final and primary energy analysis. The findings show that carbon price and zero-emission vehicle incentives do not effectively lower greenhouse gas emissions on their own; zero-emission vehicle mandates are needed to transition the sector to a low-carbon energy system. The system-wide greenhouse gas emission footprints of hydrogen and battery electric vehicles are significantly below conventional vehicles in all cases. Scenarios biased towards battery electric vehicles had the most favorable results. The greenhouse gas emission footprint of hydrogen vehicles supplied by auto-thermal reforming with 91% carbon capture was lower than for battery electric vehicles powered by a primarily natural gas-based power grid. The findings on the effectiveness of carbon prices, incentives, and vehicle mandates should be considered by government policymakers aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, infrastructure planners, and other energy stakeholders. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {As traditional non-renewable energy sources become scarcer, researchers are exploring effective strategies for producing sustainable and renewable energy. Oxygen evolution reaction through electrocatalytic water splitting (EC-OER) on the surface of a semiconductor has drawn much more attention in the worldwide as it has the principal role towards the several kind of energy applications viz. fuel cell, metal-ion rechargeable batteries and water oxidation. It is extremely difficult to develop eco-friendly, plentiful, and cost-effective nanomaterials as catalysts in order to achieve high efficiency of hydrogen production through water splitting. Furthermore, hierarchical nanostructures will become more valuable in future energy conversion applications due to their excellent physicochemical properties. Herein, we have synthesized total six different kinds of multi-metal-doped porous silica nanomaterials by utilizing the combination of nickel, iridium, and ruthenium metal slats in order to explore them as potential catalysts for electrochemical water oxidation process. We present a simple strategy to synthesize multi-metal-doped silica materials with spherical morphology, deploying a cation surfactant template (CTAB) as a structure directing agent in water-ethanol solvent mixtures. These materials are thoroughly characterized with the help of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), UV–Vis, FT-IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), nitrogen-sorption isotherm, thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. The particles are 550–600 nm in size with a fine-looking spherical morphology and surface area in the range of 111–419 m2/g. Among all of these metal-silica, Ni–Ir–Ru-doped mesoporous silica particles (NIRS) exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction (100 mA/cm2 current density@0.5V) with long-term durability up to 10 h, and the Tafel slope is also very low (∼68 mV/dec) in 1 M KOH medium. The excellent electrical conductivity of Ni–Ir–Ru-doped silica makes it a superior electrocatalyst due to its spherical morphology, synergistic effects of the multi metallic components, and its hierarchical nanoporous structure. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Long-term energy storage (LTES), such as hydrogen storage, has attracted significant attention due to its outstanding performance in storing energy over extended durations and seasonal balancing of power generation and consumption. However, planning for LTES usually necessitates the comprehensive coverage of its whole operation cycle, spanning from days to months, making the issue complex and intractable. To simplify the planning of a community integrated energy system (CIES) with LTES, this study proposes a time horizon compression (THC) method and formulates a concise long-term planning model for CIES with compressed time horizons. Then, robust optimization method with a budget uncertainty set is employed to develop a robust THC model, aimed at addressing data uncertainties in CIES planning. The proposed robust THC model is implemented in the planning of a CIES with high penetration of renewable energy sources, with the objective of minimizing the total annual cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently solve the complex CIES planning problem, resulting in a 42.77% acceleration in optimization speed. Additionally, the diversity and differentiation in THC configurations is investigated to enhance the implementation of THC in long-term CIES planning. The effectiveness of solution robustness and the significant effects of LTES on CIES are analyzed and validated in the case study. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {On the path to a net-zero-carbon economy, large-scale energy storage will be an essential part of a renewable energy system. Hydrogen generated from renewable or zero-carbon sources has significant potential as an energy storage medium, by allowing for long-duration and high-capacity energy storage. At the volumes anticipated, however, underground storage systems will likely be essential. Much like the current natural gas system, underground hydrogen storage would provide a safe and cost-effective complement to smaller surface storage infrastructure. Recently, there has been significant interest in the possibility of converting existing gas storage systems to hydrogen storage, though many uncertainties exist in such a process. This paper explores the reservoir dynamics of natural gas/hydrogen gas mixtures and the resulting impacts on storage conversion and gas deliverability. Two specific topics are addressed. First, a novel viscosity model for hydrogen-containing gas mixtures is developed, which shows better agreement with experimental measurements than the widely-used Lohrenz-Bray-Clark model. Second, detailed reservoir simulations are used to investigate cost-effective injection/withdrawal strategies for converting a natural gas storage system to one that stores hydrogen/natural-gas blends. The critical role of buoyancy and gravity override is described, and recommendations are made regarding key reservoir characteristics and injection strategies for managing this behavior. © 2023 The Author(s), Battelle Memorial Institute},

	abstract = {Allowing deeper penetration of renewable energy technologies through the adaptation of hybrid systems is unanimously considered critical for decarbonizing the building sector. The objective of this research is to analyze and contrast different renewable energy systems utilizing PV panels, an electrolyzer, and a fuel cell (FC) in a single-house and a midrise apartment located in North America. The study uses HOMER software to simulate and optimize three types of systems: PV/battery bank, PV/hydrogen, and PV/battery bank/hydrogen. The findings indicate that larger batteries can be utilized in place of the electrolyzer and fuel cell, but they incur a higher net present cost (NPC) due to their expensive initial investment. Therefore, a combination of PV arrays, hydrogen, and smaller battery banks can significantly reduce the net present cost of the system while also achieving efficient performance. After conducting an economic analysis of various setups for a single house, the research indicates that a configuration of 522 kW photovoltaic (PV) panels, 150 kW electrolyzer, 20 kW fuel cell, 200 kg hydrogen tank, 18.6 kW converter, and 159 batteries offers the most favorable results in Toronto, Canada. This configuration achieves lower NPC and levelized cost of energy (COE) than the PV/hydrogen system. In addition, according to the optimum design of the hydrogen system for the midrise apartment, the PV/battery bank/hydrogen configuration has a lower NPC and COE than the PV/hydrogen system, which shows that adding the battery to the system lowers the cost and offer short and long-term energy storage. The optimum design was then verified by implementing a sensitivity analysis to evaluate different solar radiation, electric load, derating factor and tilt angle of the PV array. © 2023},

	abstract = {To achieve a sustainable future, the adoption of renewable energies is crucial. The uneven global distribution of renewable energy necessitates efficient cross-border transportation methods. This study proposes an electricity-hydrogen-methanol-hydrogen-electricity system that utilizes methanol (MeOH) as a renewable energy carrier, facilitating the transport of green energy across borders. Our approach includes Aspen Plus plantwide simulation of MeOH synthesis, MeOH reforming, H2/CO2 separation and purification, and CO2 liquefaction processes. We evaluate each process's material balance, energy consumption, and economic evaluation, encompassing water electrolysis, MeOH/CO2 transportation, and fuel cells electricity generation. Our calculations of current, near future and sustainable future scenarios demonstrate that 10.3–8.5 MWhe of green electricity is required for electrolyzing water to produce 0.196 tonnes of hydrogen, which is then used for synthesizing MeOH (1 tonne). The imported MeOH is reformed in the importing country, recovering 94 % of hydrogen (0.184 tonnes), contributing 2.0–2.9 MWhe of electricity to the grid. The solar and wind supply chains have the CO2 emissions of 575-365 kg/MWhe and 385-257 kg/MWhe respectively. The cost ranges of imported renewable electricity, MeOH and H2 vary depending on the price of exporting renewable electricity, the capital costs, and the operating efficiencies of electrolyzers and fuel cells. These factors contribute to USD 494-106/MWhe for renewable electricity, USD 684-201/t for MeOH and USD 5,199-1,993/t for H2 in the importing countries. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The first scenario relies on domestic demand, involves blue H2 production and storage using steam methane reforming coupled with carbon capture and storage through H2 conversion to hydrogen carriers in liquid form (ammonia and methanol) aligned with the existing infrastructure. The second scenario involves green H2 production from photovoltaic panels as the power source follows by storing H2 in liquid form which is more suitable to export. The findings indicate that the blue H2 system outperforms the green H2 system in terms of energy and exergy, boasting 41.38% and 22.15% compared to 12.16% and 12.75%, respectively. However, when examining economic parameters, the blue H2 system shows a total cost rate of 1976 US$/h, a net profit of $747.2 million (mn) at the end of its lifetime, and a payback period of approximately nine years. Conversely, the green H2 system demonstrates economic indicators of a 125.2 $/h as a total cost rate, $1.26 billion (bn) net profit, and an 8.17 year payback period. Moreover, the production cost rates for blue and green H2 are 1.32 $/kg and 2.55 $/kg, respectively; while the CO2 emissions rate in the blue H2 system is 10.71 kg/s. The green H2 system prevents 19.84 kg/s of CO2 emissions resulted a significant environmental cost reduction of 2.28 $/kg H2.

	abstract = {The wake of the Paris Agreement set as a global imperative the pursuit of carbon neutrality. To achieve it, green hydrogen will play a central role, serving as an energy carrier generated from the abundant renewable energies, that can be converted into other sustainable energy carriers, such as methanol, ammonia, and hydrocarbon fuels. Even though renewable electricity is already very competitive and, in some cases, cheaper than its fossil-fuel counterpart, green hydrogen is presently still much more expensive than grey hydrogen, creating an economical impasse in the decarbonization pathway. During electrolysis, that is used to produce hydrogen from water and electricity, molecular oxygen, a byproduct, is also produced and often discarded. However, O2 is a needed feedstock in several industries, already playing an important role in co-combustion, oxidation treatments and medical applications. In this work we show how the utilization of this O2 can help green hydrogen projects to reach economic viability by proposing a new liquefaction process, simulated with the Aspen Plus® software, for high purity electrolytic O2. Depending on the scale, for green hydrogen projects in the range of 50–500 MW, a levelized cost of liquid O2 of 0.040–0.059 €/kgLO2 was obtained, competitive with the standard methods of O2 production such as cryogenic air separation and pressure swing adsorption. Considering a conservative liquid O2 selling price of 0.12 €/kgLO2, the return on investment per year for such liquefaction unit can vary between 10% for 50 MW projects and 19–20% for 250–500 MW. The returns obtained this way can be used to self-subsidize their own H2 production reducing the cost between 0.49 and 0.64 €/kgH2, respectively. The economic dynamization of electrolytic O2 through liquefaction, transforms a byproduct into a marketable commodity, which not only provides an additional revenue stream but also aligns with the broader goal of sustainable resource utilization and circular economy. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is among the energy carriers, which are most often considered for bringing about a sustainable energy system. Yet, so far, hydrogen has not delivered as an energy carrier. The core objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art and the future prospects of green hydrogen in the European energy system from economic, energetic and CO2 emissions point-of-view. The analysis shows that there are some increasing opportunities for hydrogen use in industry and in the transport sector, when electrification is not possible or is too expensive, as well as a storage in the European electricity system. However, a hydrogen-based energy system will remain a vision at least over the next decades. The major reason for this is the unfavorable economics mostly due to high investment costs in the whole supply chain. In addition, the overall efficiencies in the hydrogen chains are moderate in general. The full environmental benignity of hydrogen as an energy carrier is only provided when renewable energy sources are used for hydrogen production. However, in Europe, the potentials for green hydrogen are very limited due to the insufficient expansion of renewable electricity generation. For this reason, many European countries are considering options for green hydrogen import. The future of hydrogen is highly dependent on the supporting policy framework. To reduce the risk in the investment in hydrogen infrastructure, as well as to justify the promotion of green hydrogen, it is very important that Europe works out a very clear and realistic long-term implementation strategy. © 2024 The Authors},

This work develops an optimization model to assess flexible operational strategies for alkaline and proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers powered by wind energy. The model quantitatively analyses trade-offs between electrolyser shutdown strategies, overloading capacities, and battery integration to identify optimal regimes balancing efficiency, flexibility, and economics. The results reveal a mixed-integer linear programming approach can optimize system configurations and control strategies to minimize the levelized cost of hydrogen production. Optimal near-minimum load operation is achieved by independently optimizing the load of each electrolyser block, while avoiding shutdowns above a critical load level. Strategic electrolyser overloading can provide economic benefits by reducing installed capital costs, if technical feasibility and accelerated degradation are addressed. Battery energy storage integration significantly improves economics by enhancing asset utilization, provided excess renewable energy is available. The model provides novel insights on integrating alkaline and PEM electrolysis with intermittent wind power to advance renewable hydrogen production. Quantifying trade-offs between operational flexibility and economics will help guide flexible design and control strategies for cost-optimal renewable electrolysis systems. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Faced with international climate obligations and domestic pressure, Singapore has recently raised its climate goals significantly. The government had affirmed its intention for carbon emissions to peak before 2030 and for Singapore to attain net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However, as Singapore transitions to green energy, there remains much uncertainty if this transformation, coupled with rapidly evolving geopolitics, would present vulnerabilities to energy security. Hence, this paper is an attempt to investigate Singapore's possible paths to achieve these goals while enhancing energy security in view of present and future energy plans. Key parameters of energy security in Singapore's context are identified to determine how different policy decisions would influence them. The effects of various current and potential policies can thus be evaluated using a systems thinking and system dynamics approach to propose new energy solutions to improve energy security. System dynamics modelling reveals that new energy supply solutions would have to be considered in Singapore's Energy 2050 Plan while furthering efforts in reducing energy demand. Findings reveal that Singapore should have a target of >80% renewable energy by 2050, pursue a central strategy towards sustainable diversification of its energy sources into hydrogen, electricity imports and solar energy and reduce energy consumption. Accordingly, Singapore's energy security can then be improved in terms of the economic, energy supply chain and environmental dimensions, and towards attaining net-zero emissions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Distribution feeder reconfiguration (DFR) in distribution systems can enhance operating conditions by reducing losses and improving voltage indices. This paper introduces a dual-stage risk-based framework that concurrently tackles day-ahead reconfiguration and microgrid scheduling within the distribution network. To control the negative aspects of uncertainties, the proposed framework integrates energy storage systems (ESS/HSS) and demand response programs (DRPs) at the network level, enhancing adaptability. The initial stage of the proposed model employs the AC power flow model, utilizing loss and voltage deviation functions as objective benchmarks for network reconfiguration. The scheduling is meticulously executed per interval, deriving optimized structures under diverse scenarios with the aid of a case reduction technique (CRT) to streamline solutions. The ultimate solution employs the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm and CPLEX solver in the first and second stages respectively. Outcomes from applying this approach to the adjusted 118-bus network manifest improved operational conditions and voltage quality through reconfiguration. Impressively, the integration of ESS/HSS and DRPs yields a substantial 22.34% reduction in total operating costs, a conclusion substantiated by the numerical findings. Furthermore, by leveraging the CRT, a remarkable 56.17% reduction in problem-solution time is achieved. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The development of cost-effective and highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media plays a crucial role in advancing renewable energy conversion technologies. In this study, we successfully constructed a three-dimensional (3D) composite on nickel foam (NF) by coupling NiFe-LDH nanosheets with NiCoS nanoparticles decorated NiCo-LDH nanosheets, resulting in a NiCo-LDH@NiCoS@NiFe-LDH hierarchical heterostructure. The resulting composite exhibits abundant heterogeneous interfaces and a well-defined nanosheet array structure, allowing for numerous exposed surface active sites and open channels. The strong synergistic effect among its various components allows the heterogeneous structure to effectively optimize the electronic structures of the metal active sites. Consequently, the NiCo-LDH@NiCoS@NiFe-LDH composite demonstrated remarkable catalytic activity towards OER, achieving current densities of 50 and 100 mA cm−2 at overpotentials as low as 209 and 224 mV, respectively. This result manifests a substantial improvement over recently developed electrocatalysts based on earth-abundant elements. Additionally, the NiCo-LDH@NiCoS@NiFe-LDH composite can efficiently catalyze HER in an alkaline medium, with a low overpotential of 93 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1 M KOH solution. Moreover, the electrolytic cell utilizing NiCo-LDH@NiCoS@NiFe-LDH as the electrodes could realize overall water splitting with an ultralow cell voltage of 1.55 V at 10 mA cm−2, and excellent electrochemical stability. These findings underscore the potential for developing high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts with significant implications for large-scale commercial applications of renewable energy technologies. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {As energy system research into high shares of renewables has developed, so have the perspectives of the fundamental nature of a highly renewable economy. Early energy system transition research suggested that current fossil fuel energy systems would transition to a ‘Hydrogen Economy’, whereas more recent insights suggest that a ‘Power-to-X Economy’ may be a more appropriate term, as renewable electricity will become both the most important primary and final energy carrier through various Power-to-X conversion routes across the energy system. This paper provides a detailed overview on research insights of recent years on the core elements of the Power-to-X Economy and the role of hydrogen based on latest research results. These results suggest that, by 2050, upwards of 61,737 TWhLHV of hydrogen will be required to fully defossilise the global energy-industry system. Hydrogen, therefore, emerges as a central intermediate energy carrier and its relevance is driven by significant cost reductions in renewable electricity, especially of solar photovoltaics and wind power. Efficiency and cost drivers position direct electrification as the primary solution for defossilisation of the global energy-industry system; however, electron-to-molecule routes are essential for the large subset of remaining energy-related demands including chemical production, marine and aviation fuels, and steelmaking. © 2023 The Author(s)},

However, uncertainties surrounding the future hydrogen market and its supply costs impede the establishment of its value chain. Without definite plans for hydrogen production and infrastructure, investing in low-carbon hydrogen industrial processes is risky. Simultaneously, the absence of solid market interest poses challenges in deploying a hydrogen backbone. In recent years, European gas Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany, have introduced various roadmaps for their prospective national hydrogen network. Despite the infrastructure proposals, detailed quantitative scenario analysis for the future hydrogen supply chain is still missing.

A regionalization method is proposed to allocate the potential hydrogen consumption in different industrial sectors across various clusters within a country, represented as the prospective hydrogen demand nodes.

	abstract = {Electrochemical energy conversion (via water splitting) and storage (via supercapacitors) are emerging strategies for developing the renewable energy sector; nevertheless, the hunt for low-cost and effective electrode material is a bottleneck issue. Herein, a bimetallic manganese nickel hydroxide was electrodeposited on Ni-foam without polymeric binder, followed by calcination to reveal its oxide configuration. As prepared, manganese nickel hydroxide (MnNi-hydroxide) displayed low Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotentials of 231 mV and 327 mV at 10 mA/cm2 during electrochemical water splitting, along with a superior turnover frequency of 0.12 sec−1 and 0.056 sec−1, respectively. Theoretical investigations revealed an increase in MnNi-hydroxide activity due to synergistic electronic interaction between Mn and Ni. Further, the MnNi-hydroxide, having high specific capacitances of 1174 mF/cm2 at 2 mV/s and 308 mF/cm2 at 1 mA/cm2, demonstrated a retention capacity of 98.9% over 5000 cycles. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) plays a critical role in ensuring the stability and security of the future clean energy supply. However, the efficiency and reliability of UHS technology depend heavily on the careful and criteria-driven selection of suitable storage sites. This study presents a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making framework integrating the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organisation Method for Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE) to identify and select the best hydrogen storage sites among depleted gas reservoirs in the UK. To achieve this, a new set of site selection criteria is proposed in light of the technical and economic aspects of UHS, including location, reservoir rock quality and tectonic characteristics, maximum achievable hydrogen well deliverability rate, working gas capacity, cushion gas volume requirement, distance to future potential hydrogen clusters, and access to intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs). The framework is implemented to rank 71 reservoirs based on their potential and suitability for UHS. Firstly, the reservoirs are thoroughly evaluated for each proposed criterion and then the AHP-PROMETHEE technique is employed to prioritise the criteria and rank the storage sites. The study reveals that the total calculated working gas capacity based on single-well plateau withdrawal rates is around 881 TWh across all evaluated reservoirs. The maximum well deliverability rates for hydrogen withdrawal are found to vary considerably among the sites; however, 22 % are estimated to have deliverability rates exceeding 100 sm3/d, and 63 % are located within a distance of 100 km from a major hydrogen cluster. Moreover, 70 % have access to nearby RESs developments, with an estimated cumulative RESs capacity of approximately 181 GW. The results highlight the efficacy of the proposed multi-criteria site selection framework. The top five highest-ranked sites for UHS based on the evaluated criteria are the Cygnus, Hamilton, Saltfleetby, Corvette, and Hatfield Moors gas fields. The insights provided by this study can contribute to informed decision-making, sustainable development, and the overall progress of future UHS projects within the UK and globally. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Due to the depletion of fossil fuels and the emission of greenhouse gases, it is necessary to analyze energy supply solutions based on renewable energy sources in this industrial sector. Unlike other sectors, such as residential or service industries, which have been thoroughly analyzed by the scientific community, the use of renewable energies in the chemical industry remains comparatively less examined by the scientific community. This article studies the use of an energy supply system based on photovoltaic technology or a PEM fuel cell for a styrene production industry, analyzing the integration of energy storage systems such as batteries, as well as different uses for the surplus hydrogen produced by the facility. The most interesting conclusions of the article are: (1) the renewable microgrid considered is viable both technically and economically with a discounted payback period between 5.4 and 6.5 years, using batteries as an energy storage system; and (2) the use of hydrogen as energy storage system for a styrene industry is not yet a viable option from an economic point of view. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study assesses the competitiveness of producing green hydrogen (H2) in Saudi Arabia and Germany using a power-to-carrier (P2X) model in PLEXOS for 2030 and beyond. The target amount of H2 to be produced serves as the only exogenous input, allowing the model, which runs on an hourly temporal resolution, to endogenously optimize the electrolyzer technology (alkaline, proton exchange membrane, or solid oxide electrolyzer cell), the capacity of the electrolyzer to be built, and the optimal carbon-free energy mix. Results suggest the overall investment needs in Saudi Arabia are approximately 25% lower than those for wind-based hydrogen production in Germany, with the best-case scenario to produce 0.213 Mt of green H2 costing a net present value of $6.20 billion in Saudi Arabia, compared to $8.11 billion in Germany. The findings indicate that alkaline electrolyzers dominate the production process, favored for their low cost despite the higher efficiencies of other electrolyzer types. Moreover, the model opts to dump excess energy rather than construct battery storage. Based on 16 scenarios, the study determines a levelized cost of hydrogen of 2.34–3.08 $/kg for Saudi Arabia, compared with 3.06–3.69 $/kg in Germany. Subsequently, a detailed sensitivity analysis considers various discount rates for both countries. It is concluded that even when considering shipment costs from Saudi Arabia to Germany (∼1 $/kg), green H2 can still be competitively delivered from Saudi Arabia to Germany. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Renewable hydrogen is considered as one of the key technologies that may be needed to fully decarbonise our economies, providing the high-temperature heat, fuels and feedstock that might not be possible to electrify. Several pilot projects are underway, and some assessments of the economics of green hydrogen have been published. However, most of them have assessed the costs of producing renewable hydrogen in large-scale, grid-connected units. Another option, pointed by many as a robust strategy in the early stages, is to produce hydrogen locally, in “hydrogen valleys”, to serve industrial demand. In this paper, the economics of the different technical configurations and strategies that might be used for this decentralised, variable-demand option are analysed, accounting for the impact that a non-constant operation may cause on the operational efficiency of electrolysers, and for the potential benefits of local hydrogen storage. Our results show that when hydrogen demand is variable, production costs are higher compared to the constant demand case, due to the higher electrolyser size required. Electricity price optimization plus hydrogen storage can be a valuable option in some cases, although the cost benefit is negligible (about 1%) unless price volatility in the market increases with higher RES shares, or investment costs decrease significantly. Sourcing electricity exclusively from a dedicated renewable power plant can only become competitive if electricity market prices rise as observed recently or triggered by increasing CO2 prices. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Results demonstrate that the substantial costs associated with the current hydrogen industry can be effectively subsidized via the implementation of proposed business models. When the carbon emission price falls within the range of approximately 86–105 USD/ton, free access to hydrogen becomes a viable option for end-users.

	abstract = {Almost half of the European railways are served by diesel-powered trains used for both cargo and passenger transport. Similar considerations apply to the bus sector in urban and suburban areas. The decarbonization of the transport sector can be achieved by using hydrogen as a fuel for trains and buses. However, the main barrier to adopting hydrogen fuel cell trains and buses is the construction of adequate infrastructure. Thus, to foster a sustainable energy transition, existing renewable plants should be considered when designing new hydrogen supply chains. In the proposed Sicilian case study, existing wind farms are chosen as electricity production plants. Most of them have been shut down due to grid unbalancing issues; still, the curtailed renewable electricity could be used to produce zero-carbon hydrogen via water electrolysis, significantly reducing costs. To account for this opportunity, this study models the hydrogen production, transportation, and refueling stages, employing a mixed-integer linear programming approach to find the optimal location and capacities of hydrogen infrastructure, while minimizing the total daily cost of the supply chain. The model is applied to Sicily and different scenarios for varying hydrogen demands for trains and buses are analyzed and discussed. Results show that capital expenses cover more than 90% of the total cost of the supply chain, with a hydrogen cost dispensed at the filling station ranging from 6.32 to 9.02 €/kgH2. The environmental analysis shows that as hydrogen demand rises, so do the carbon emissions from the distribution stage. However, the impact of using wind-generated electricity in terms of avoided emissions is notably greater. Finally, it is shown that transporting hydrogen in gaseous form using tube trailers is economically more attractive than transportation in liquid form with tanker trucks in the early stages of the network. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a clean and sustainable renewable energy source with significant potential for use in energy storage applications because of its high energy density. In particular, underground hydrogen storage via the dissolution of hydrogen gas in an aqueous solution has been identified as a promising strategy to address the difficulties associated with large-scale energy storage. However, this process requires the accurate prediction of the solubility of hydrogen in aqueous solutions, which is affected by a range of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the presence of solutes. The present study thus aimed to effectively predict the solubility of hydrogen in aqueous solutions that vary in their salinity by employing a machine learning approach. Four machine learning models were developed and tested: adaptive gradient boosting (Adaboost), gradient boosting, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. The performance of each model was quantified in terms of their coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). The Adaboost algorithm exhibited superior performance across all metrics, with an R2 of 0.994, MAE of 0.006, and RMSE of 0.018. A Williams plot detected only 18 outliers in the Adaboost predictions from a total of 255 data points. These results indicate that machine learning techniques have the potential to serve as a valuable tool in the prediction of hydrogen solubility in aqueous solutions for underground hydrogen storage, facilitating the development of smart, cost-effective, and safe hydrogen storage technologies. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Its potential is immense in renewable-rich Asian economies, however, its production is yet to start with key factors such as safety parameters, resources, proper government incentives, and public acceptability affecting its optimal generation. This study employs three multi-criteria decision-making approach like analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and Fuzzy-AHP followed by the sensitivity analysis to identify and prioritize the robustness of the five primary potentials (social, political, economic, technical, and environmental). Subsequently, categorized into 22 sub-potentials of green hydrogen and ideal renewable resource for the sustainable development objective of India. The results of the DEMATEL analysis suggest that the social is the key predictor and the last one is Technical. The Fuzzy-TOPSIS method suggests that solar is the best renewable energy resource followed by wind, small hydro, and biomass energy. Hence, the government's intervention and robust policy frameworks are required to increase its production with special emphasis on cost considering solar energy. The finding of this study will guide the governments, energy sector players, producers, environmental advocacy groups, and users to make a strategic decision regarding the choice of the most viable source of renewable energy to achieve the targets of sustainable development Goals (SDGs-7). © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A novel multi-generation solar-wind system is proposed in this study, uniting solar and wind renewable energy sources to enhance system reliability. The system incorporates hydrogen energy storage for continuous day and night energy harvesting, offering novel advancements in both reliability and uninterrupted energy supply. The system consists of parabolic through solar collectors (PTSCs), wind turbines (WTs), a steam Rankine cycle-thermoelectric generator (SRC-TEG), a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination unit, a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, hydrogen compression unit and a PEM fuel cell (PEMFC). During the day, the system produces power, fresh water and hydrogen, and at night, when the solar cycle is inactive, the system produces power using a fuel cell that consumes the hydrogen stored in the hydrogen tank. Also, the multi-generation system is fully evaluated from the point of view of energy, exergy and economy in both day and night modes. The proposed system is capable of generating 1624.7 kW of power during the day and 1290.4 kW of power at night. In addition, fresh water can be produced at a rate of 24.29 kg/s and hydrogen at a rate of 8.39 kg/h during the day. Moreover, meteorological data identifies Khaf city as highly suitable for harnessing solar and wind energy on an hourly and yearly basis. Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) and multi-objective optimization are used to optimize the system performance.

	abstract = {In the contemporary global discourse on environmental and developmental issues, the dual challenges of sustainable green energy and water supply stand paramount. These elements are vitally intertwined with the socio-economic vitality of the world. Notably, regions plagued by freshwater scarcity are increasingly turning to desalination which consists of a reliable and unconventional water source. The intersection of renewable energy with desalination and water purification processes presents a compelling synergy. This approach is particularly pertinent in areas where freshwater shortages coexist with abundant solar energy availability. Additionally, these technologies boast the advantage of low operational and maintenance costs. This paper delves into the design, optimization and financial analysis of a novel, standalone hybrid energy system, integrating photovoltaic and fuel cell technologies, for an agriculture farm situated in Kairouan, Tunisia. Unlike conventional systems, this model foregoes battery storage in favour of hydrogen storage, generated through water electrolysis powered by solar energy. This system harnesses solar energy for direct electrical power generation and hydrogen gas production. A segment of the generated electricity is allocated to electrolysis for green hydrogen production. In times of solar unavailability, the stored hydrogen is reconverted to electricity via a fuel cell. An intriguing aspect of this system is the utilization of saline well water, which, due to its high salt content, necessitates purification through desalination to prevent damage to the electrolysis unit and to render it suitable for agricultural irrigation. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The analysis includes research conducted over the past decade, covering from 2014 to 2023 (till August). Several key aspects are highlighted, including publication trends, the leading country in research output, journal rankings, and a citation analysis of papers related to water electrolysis. The findings reveal a notable increase in publication trends, with China emerging as the leading contributor in this research area. Furthermore, the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy is identified as the highest-ranked journal in terms of both publication number and citation impact. Additionally, the top ten most cited research articles and review papers are investigated to determine their influence within the field. To gain a deeper understanding of water electrolysis methods, the three primary approaches: alkaline water electrolysis (AWE), proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis (SOE) is examined. The analysis emphasizes that PEM electrolysis is the most prevalent method for hydrogen generation, particularly when integrated with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power due to its rapid response to electrical input fluctuation. Finally, the challenges and future directions of water electrolysis in hydrogen production are highlighted, including an exploration of economic and environmental considerations at large scale, offering insights into the path forward for advancing this technology sustainably. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {One of the main barriers to the adoption of fuel cell vehicles (FCEVs) is the limited availability of hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs). The presence of these stations is crucial in facilitating the provision of fuel for FCEVs, which rely on hydrogen as a source of power generation. Renewable energy sources offer significant advantages for hydrogen production at these stations, as they are environmentally friendly and can reduce costs. In this study, it is provided a techno-economic analysis of an on-site hydrogen refuelling station powered by a hybrid renewable energy generation system using HOMER software in Niğde, Türkiye, and Zaragoza, Spain. Three different power system scenarios were evaluated to refuel 24 vehicles per day for each region throughout the year. The results of the analysis showed that the most optimal system architecture for Niğde was with a solar panel power generation system, with a levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of 6.15 $/kg and the net present cost (NPC) of $6,832,393. The most optimal system architecture for Zaragoza was a wind turbine-photovoltaic panel power generation system, with an LCOH of 5.83 $/kg and NPC of $6,499,723. The annual amount of CO2 emissions avoided by using renewable resources in hydrogen production was calculated as 2,673,453 kg for Niğde and 2,366,573 kg for Zaragoza. The study also found that the cost of hydrogen production increases with decreasing the HRS production capacity. The use of renewable energy generation systems for hydrogen production will enable countries to achieve net-zero emission targets and reduce the need to import fossil fuels to meet energy demands in the transportation sector. The present study makes several contributions towards the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (3, 7, 11, and 13) and has the potential to facilitate the rapid adoption of FCEVs. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this study, we employed first-principles calculations to investigate the catalytic activities of the synthetic material g-C4N3 as an electrocatalyst for HER, OER, and ORR by incorporating various transition metal atoms into the numerous 3 N vacancies (TM@g-C4N3) naturally occurring in its primitive structure. Our calculations reveal that Cu@g-C4N3 holds promise as a trifunctional electrocatalyst, exhibiting low OER/ORR overpotentials (ηOER = ηORR = 0.44 V) and a |ΔG∗H| value of only 0.08 eV. Furthermore, Ni@g-C4N3_S1N2 exhibits a lower OER overpotential (ηOER = 0.34 V). Bader charge analysis, charge density difference calculations, and D-band center investigations confirm that the catalytic performance is fundamentally rooted in the electronic properties of these materials. Thus, g-C4N3 embedded with transition metal atoms shows promise as an efficient electrocatalyst for OER/ORR/HER, with implications for the development of high-efficiency trifunctional electrocatalysts. © 2023},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an aggregated flexibility estimation method considering the distributed electricity-hydrogen (H2) interactions for virtual power plants (VPPs) to enhance the economic benefits from the peak-regulation market (PRM) while facilitating the accommodation of renewable generation. Firstly, various distributed energy resources (DERs) such as electric vehicles (EVs), air conditioning systems (ACs), and electricity-H2 coupled hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) are modeled as virtual storage (VS) with characterized charging/discharging response parameters. Besides, the temporal coupling power profile of VS can be abstracted as a polytope from the geometric perspective, and the aggregated high-dimensional flexibility region of VPP is formulated by the Minkowski sum for these polytopes. Furthermore, a day-ahead peak-regulation optimal scheduling model considering the conditional value at risk (CVaR) is developed for the electricity-H2 integrated VPP participating the PRM, and the dimensionality of the aggregated polytope is reduced by the inscribed hyperbox approximation to provide a compact and concise scheduling region. Comparative studies have validated the aggregated power range and net income can be improved by 13.05% and 15.11% with the mechanism of electricity and hydrogen integrations. © 2023},

	abstract = {Renewables (i.e., solar and wind power) in the Nordic area have highly seasonal characteristics, which severely restrict the wide development of renewables since they can be excessive in summer but insufficient in winter with intermittent outputs. The conventional battery energy storage system (BESS) with short-term adjustment functionality cannot eliminate the seasonal imbalance of renewables. In this regard, a risk-based bi-level planning model is presented to maximize the hosting capacity (HC) of renewables through configuring seasonal hydrogen storage (SHS) and BESS. Specifically, the upper level applies a multi-objective scheme to maximize HC and minimize the investment cost simultaneously. In turn, the lower level is driven by maximizing the profits of the distribution system operator (DSO) with the implementation of price-based demand response (PBDR). Due to forecasting errors of renewables and load resulting from intermittent output and random behaviors, a stochastic programming (SP) method is developed to address and adapt multiple uncertain fluctuations. Moreover, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is introduced to measure the effect of the risks raised by multiple uncertainties on system operation. Finally, numerical studies are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. Compared to the cases without considering PBDR and SHS, the total renewable energy HC in the proposed model is increased by 2.30 MW and 0.37 MW, respectively, while the yearly cost benefit of DSO is enhanced by 28063.2 US$ and 17823.7 US$, respectively. The promising results demonstrate the empowerment of SHS can promote the cross-seasonal consumption of renewables, effectively maximizing the HC and improving the economic operation of distribution systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper proposed a long-term equilibrium including electricity, gas and carbon markets to study the price effect of the system and its impact on the carbon-gas- electricity sector. The simulation results indicate that the main impact of the system on the electricity sector is to reduce energy curtailment and provide flexible resource for the electric system. P2G used an excess of 22.21 TWh of renewable energy, while CCS used 2.65 TWh of electricity to operate the capture system. The multi-energy system will reduce the market clearing price in the gas market (the annual average gas price decreased from 276.90 to 276.30 yuan/MWh). However, the partial transfer of flexibility to the electricity sector may increase cost in the gas industry, which in turn will be transferred back to the electricity sector again. In addition, through the operation of multi-energy system, carbon elements will circulate in the three sectors. CCS will become a carbon price-maker when electricity scarcity and carbon quota tightening, and increase carbon prices, which will increase the utilization hours of CCS and P2G and their profitability. © 2024},

The aim is to determine how well nuclear and solar technologies perform together and to quantify the effect of hybridization on the solar photovoltaic field size and the cost of hydrogen production at different values of the solar photovoltaic cell efficiency and solar irradiation. The effect of heat recovery on the hydrogen production cost has also been studied. Results indicate that photovoltaic field size and hydrogen production cost are reduced with hybridization. For a photovoltaic cell efficiency of 20%, a daily solar irradiation of 5 kWh/m2 and no heat recovery, there is a decrease in hydrogen production cost of about 0.12 $/kg by percent decrease in solar fraction for hybridization at the low solar fraction range. This decrease goes to about 0.14 $/kg by percent decrease in solar fraction for hybridization at the high solar fraction range. In the case of heat recovery, there is an increase in the reduction in hydrogen production cost with an increase in heat recovery rate. For a hybridization at 10% solar fraction, the rate of increase in the reduction in the hydrogen production cost is 0.86 cents/percent increase in heat recovery rate; this rate goes up to 2.47 cents/percent increase in heat recovery for hybridization at solar fraction of 80%. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Water electrolysis, powered by renewable energy, is a leading method for producing high-purity hydrogen and oxygen. Among electrolyzer systems, alkaline and polymer exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are prevalent, with PEM being preferred for large-scale energy storage due to its superior energy efficiency. Therefore, the current development of PEM technology is mainly focused on costs reduction, improvement of performance and durability. However, the degradation at high current densities has not received thorough exploration thus far. In this research, machine learning algorithms were applied to experimental data from commercial PEM water electrolyzers (PEMWE) to examine the impact of various factors including operating temperature, current density, the transport/catalyst layer interface, and catalyst loading. The study focused on how temperature affects three anode catalysts (Ir-black, IrO2 and Ir0.7Ru0.3Ox), the role of pore diameter in the transport layer, and different anode catalyst loadings on cell potential performance. Additionally, the influence of temperature and current density on the degradation of PEMWEs, particularly on the anode side, was analyzed using machine learning techniques. In this study, the machine learning techniques employed were support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN). The findings indicated that SVR, when its hyper-parameters are fine-tuned using a genetic algorithm (GA), can achieve prediction accuracy comparable to an ANN with a fully connected architecture consisting of two hidden layers, each with 30 nodes. The algorithms’ predictions indicated that PEMWE can be operated at conditions that enhance the performance and life time, subsequently leading to cost reduction in hydrogen ensuring widespread adoption of PEM electrolyzers for hydrogen production. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is a technology with a major role in linking the hydrogen production to renewable energy resources with a volatile behaviour such as wind and solar. High amounts of precious metals and a labour intensive production also make it a cost intensive technology. A tubular cell design has the potential to reduce production costs by co-extrusion of cells which feature a reduced sealing length. For the inner half cell, additive manufacturing (AM) of titanium offers a high degree of freedom for the electrode design to reach a high electric conductivity and active surface area. In combination with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of iridium catalyst a porous transport electrode (PTE) can be fabricated. Using planar test cell results and model based PTE design, this study demonstrates the feasibility of a tubular PEMEL cell consisting of an additively manufactured, iridium coated anode PTE in the inner half cell, an extruded membrane and a platinum coated graphite felt cathode PTE in the outer half cell. The outer titanium current collector can be replaced by an extruded graphite polymer compound current collector to reduce the amount of titanium without performance losses. The cell is operated at 60 °C in 1 mol L−1 sulphuric acid and experimentally characterized by polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). At 2.0 V cell potential a current density of ≈450mAcm−2 was reached corresponding to an iridium mass specific current density >1500Ag−1 which is significant larger than literature values. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Microgrid (MG) integrated with renewable energy sources (RES) has become increasingly popular, especially when the lack of resources and environmental pollution are serious. However, the uncertainty of RES is the major problem when operating MG. The hydrogen energy storage system (HESS) is a prominent solution for the RES uncertainty since it can store excess energy, supply when in shortage, help to regulate power consumption, and improve MG's flexibility. In this research, a bi-level optimization model for planning the microgrid is proposed. The upper layer of the optimization model aims to minimize the total operation cost of the MG, while the lower level focuses on minimizing the operation cost of the hydrogen energy storage system. The results demonstrate that the proposed bi-level model can help to reduce the operation cost of MG by 42.75% in comparison with typical single level optimization model. Additionally, the electricity generated by diesel generators has also decreased by 52.43%, resulting in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions and contributing to environmental protection. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Amidst the growing imperative to address carbon emissions, renewable energy combined cooling heating and power (RCCHP) systems have emerged as a transformative alternative to their fossil fuel-driven counterparts. Given the intermittent and volatile nature of renewable energy, the integration of energy storage technology has taken center stage in the exploration of RCCHP systems. This paper presents a quantitative techno-economic assessment of seven prominent energy storage configurations, including battery (BAT), thermal energy storage (TES), hydrogen storage (HS), and their combinations within the context of RCCHP systems. To avoid potential deviations caused by the rule-based energy dispatch strategy, the optimization problem is solved by a deterministic tool named mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Meanwhile, an accuracy assessment is performed on various time series aggregation methods to ensure the reliability of optimization outcomes. The key results revealed that the optimal storage configuration varies with different self-sufficiency rate (SSR) requirements. The BAT+HS+TES emerges as the most cost-effective configuration to implement 100% SSR requirements. The annualized total cost (ATC) of BAT+HS+TES configuration is 11% ∼ 39.5% lower than other single or combined energy storage configurations. In addition, HS stands as a more economical technology for countering the off-grid effect than BAT or TES. The underestimated ATC for the RCCHP system enlarges with escalating SSR requirements when using inappropriate aggregation methods. The maximum underestimation of ATC reaches −34.8% under the 100% SSR requirement when only using one typical day from each season. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

An enormous amount of food waste (FW) is produced throughout the food production chain, which threatens human health and the environment. Waste-to-biogas conversion, as a prime example of waste-to-energy technology, offers a simple approach to simultaneously address the issue of the rising demand for renewable energy sources. Anaerobic digestion (AD) of FW produces biofuel, bioenergy, and fertilizers. In addition to providing a sustainable waste management alternative to landfills, the creation of hydrogen through resource recovery and waste material conversion processes can be used to produce renewable fuels. To be taken seriously as a candidate for manufacturing hydrogen, it must be economically feasible, cutting costs and providing a sustainable waste management option.

	abstract = {Shifting from fossil fuels to clean alternative fuel options such as hydrogen is an essential step in decarbonising the road freight transport sector and facilitating an efficient transition towards zero-emissions goods distribution of the future. Designing an economically viable and competitive Hydrogen Supply Chain (HSC) to support and accelerate the widespread adoption of hydrogen powered Heavy Goods Vehicles (H2-HGVs) is, however, significantly hindered by the lack of the infrastructure required for producing, storing, transporting and distributing the required hydrogen. This paper focuses on a bespoke design of a hydrogen supply chain and distribution network for the long-haul road freight transportation in the UK and develops an improved end-to-end and spatially-explicit optimisation tool to perform scenario analysis and provide important first-hand managerial and policy making insights. The proposed methodology improves over existing grid-based methodologies by incorporating spatially-explicit locations of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRSs) and allowing further flexibility and accuracy. Another distinctive feature of the method and the analyses carried out in the paper pertains to the inclusion of bulk geographically agnostic, as well as geological underground hydrogen storage options, and reporting on significant cost saving opportunities. Finally, the curve for H2-HGVs penetration levels, safety stock period decisions, and the transport mode capacity against hydrogen levelized cost at pump have been generated as important policy making tools to provide decision support and insights into cost, resilience and reliability of the HSC. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Renewable sources include wind sources and bio-waste units, where the latter simultaneously plays a role in electrical and thermal energy generation. Hydrogen and thermal storage are used as a source of flexibility in the hub. The proposed scheme has a two-level formulation. Its upper level considers the participation of hubs in the energy market. It maximizes the expected profit of energy hubs by observing the operational constraints of power sources and storage devices (in the form of a hub) and the hub's flexibility limitation. The lower-level problem presents the market clearing price model. In this problem, the expected operation cost of the generation units in the electric and thermal networks is minimized subject to satisfying the constraints of the optimal power flow of the mentioned networks. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker method provides a single-level formulation of the scheme. Also, stochastic optimization is adopted to model the uncertainties of load and renewable power to examine the flexibility of energy hubs accurately. Finally, by evaluating the numerical results obtained from different study cases, the scheme can improve the operating conditions of energy networks and obtain optimal flexibility and economic conditions for energy hubs. The hydrogen storage device next to the thermal storage device can achieve 100% flexibility conditions for the hubs. Storage devices can enhance the economic status of renewable hubs by about 9.2%.

This study investigates the role of liquid hydrogen (LH2) in a national, greenhouse gas-neutral energy supply system for Germany in 2045. The integrated energy system model suite ETHOS is extended by LH2 demand profiles in the sectors aviation, mobility, and chemical industry and means of LH2 transportation via inland vessel, rail, and truck. This case study demonstrates that the type of hydrogen demand (liquid or gaseous) can strongly affect the cost-optimal design of the future energy system. When LH2 demand is introduced to the energy system, LH2 import, transportation, and production grow in importance. This decreases the need for gaseous hydrogen (GH2) pipelines and affects the location of H2 production plants. When identifying no-regret measures, it must be considered, that the largest H2 consumers are the ones with the highest readiness to use LH2. © 2023 The Author(s)},

However, due to the scope of the respective studies, not all techno-economic aspects of the supply-chain that influence levelized costs of hydrogen are considered. This work represents a systematical analysis of the levelized costs of hydrogen in Egypt by using wind and solar power for producing 40 kt per year of green hydrogen. A maximal investment volume of four billion euros, and an available area of 37 km2 in central Egypt is assumed. The techno-economic evaluation of the system, from the production site to the selling location, is conducted by a mixed-integer linear optimization model. Depending on the system configuration and production site, the study reveals energy losses of 52–61% of the harvested energy and a levelized costs of hydrogen of 7.17–12.31 €/kg. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Renewable energy is of prime importance for sustainable development. Hydrogen is considered as clean as well as an efficient energy source. In addition to H2 as fuel, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell requires oxygen as an oxidant. Electrocatalytic or photocatalytic water splitting processes yield H2 and O2. Compared to hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis is a very sluggish and slow process. Even precious and costly catalysts have demonstrated higher overpotential for OER. To overcome the issues related to overpotential as well as cost and durability, bio-inspired macrocycles and polymers based on phthalocyanine are being explored extensively because of their unique and versatile properties. In this effort, a novel cobalt phthalocyanine polymer (poly-CoTPzPyCPc) was synthesised and employed as a low-cost and efficient organic-based catalyst for OER. The characterized polymeric catalyst was coated on Ni foam and the fabricated electrodes were evaluated for OER in 0.1 M KOH. The electrodes Ni-foam, Ni/poly-CoTPzPyCPc, Ni/IrO2, and Ni/poly-CoTPzPyCPc + IrO2 exhibited an onset potential for OER at 1.57, 1.53, 1.47 and 1.43 V Vs. RHE, respectively. The Ni/poly-CoTPzPyCPc exhibited an overpotential of 365 mV (±2 mV) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the composite of poly-CoTPzPyCPc with IrO2, displayed surprisingly superior OER activity. The composite achieved a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at lower overpotential of 274 mV (±2 mV) than the polymeric phthalocyanine and benchmark IrO2 catalyst which showed an overpotential of 324 mV at the same current density. The Tafel slope value was found to be 89, 67, 34 and 31 mV/dec for pure Ni foam, Ni/poly-CoTPzPyCPc, Ni/IrO2 and Ni/poly-CoTPzPyCPc + IrO2, respectively. The stability studies performed on poly-CoTPzPyCPc + IrO2 composite catalyst revealed that the proposed catalyst is stable and can be successfully employed for OER in water electrolysis. The developed composite catalyst has a small amount loading of precious catalyst with simple organic based catalyst to achieve efficiency better than benchmark catalyst for OER. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {One of the reasons why renewable energies are so attractive compared to fossil fuels is their low environmental impact. In addition, geothermal power plants contribute tremendously to sustainable energy generation for cities despite their lower energy efficiency than fossil fuel plants. The multi-heat recovery will eliminate the applicability defect mentioned. Therefore, this paper studies a novel tri-generation schema with the maximum use of heat loss through a multi-heat recovery technique in two principal processes, namely waste heat-to-power and power-to-H2 and -purified water. A double-flash binary cycle, Rankine cycle, electrolyzer unit, and reverse osmosis desalination system all play a part in the creation of this system. The technical feasibility of the system is scrutinized based on energy-exergy, environmental, sustainability, and exergoeconomic metrics and bi-objective optimization. Generally, 1st separator pressure made the strongest effect on the measured variables among decision variables. The increase in this parameter led to an upward-and-downward behavior of the net electricity and exergetic efficiency; while the cost of products experienced a converse trend. Also, the produced H2 and purified water together with the tri-generation gain output ratio augmented. Changes were not observed in net electricity and purified water with the change in 2nd separator pressure, but the H2 production rate changed significantly. Through bi-objective optimization, net electricity, purified water production rate, and total investment cost rate also significantly increase. Based on the optimum design mode, the CO2 emission rate and the sustainability index are higher than under the base case design. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Today, population growth, industrialization and economic growth increase the consumption of fossil fuels to meet the energy demand. The scarcity of fossil fuels and the harmful gases they generate increase the interest in renewable energy sources. One of these sources is hydrogen energy, which is plentiful in nature and has no negative environmental effects. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a good source of hydrogen, but a catalyst must used for methanolysis. Besides producing energy, it is also important to store it. Supercapacitors are a good alternative to energy storage elements due to their outstanding advantages. In this work, Dunaliella salina (DS) microalgae were used as substrate to synthesize activated carbon for the first time to develop materials that can operate both as a catalyst and an electrode material for supercapacitors. The activated carbon was obtained by carbonization and activation and the taguchi experimental approach was used to minimize the number of experiments. The best hydrogen production rate (HPR) result for DS-9 catalyst with 0.10 g catalyst and 0.25 g NaBH4 at ambient temperature of 60 °C was determined to be 13,085 mL min−1gcat−1. The material with the best HPR value was then used as the electrode material for supercapacitor design. The specific capacitance value for 1 A/g was determined using galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) curves to be 216 F/g. In addition, the produced supercapacitor has an energy density of 13.80 W h/kg at a power density of 480 W/kg. The results indicate that the ecologically friendly and cost effective bifunctional materials produced can be used both in reuse of organic wastes and in catalyst and supercapacitor applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This paper computes and analyzes the levelized cost of hydrogen with the emissions associated for each part of the complete hydrogen supply chain. Two different production sources were used: renewable energies sources and the Argentine electrical grid; and two production pathways: in situ and centralized production. Comparing the same volume of proposed hydrogen compressed natural gas and current CNG, a cost decrease in the majority of the scenarios and a CO2eq emission reduction ranging from 19.5 to 8.2% are achieved, even if the hydrogen is produced using the carbon-intensive grid electricity. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen has the potential to be considered almost the cleanest fuel of the future and a key contributor toward a low-carbon economy. This latter can be achieved through the production of green hydrogen by electrolysis using renewable energy sources. This work investigates the production of green hydrogen using solar PV-electrolysis configuration. Three different photovoltaic technologies including monocrystalline (m-Si), polycrystalline (p-Si) and amorphous (a-Si) have been used in this study. The aim of this paper is to identify the most suitable PV system for hydrogen production in mountain temperate climate conditions. Therefore, a performance assessment of the aforementioned PV systems has been conducted using data collected for an operation period of 6 years. In addition, the rate of degradation of each technology has been determined, and its effects on hydrogen generation and cost have been examined. The obtained results have shown that p-Si technology has the lowest degradation rate of (0.28%), followed by m-Si (0.41%), and a-Si (0.75%). In addition, key metrics including the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as well as the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) have been calculated. The findings indicate that the lowest LCOE and LCOH are achieved by p-Si (0.021 $/kWh, 3.59 $/kg), followed by a-Si technology (0.027 $/kWh, 4 $/kg), and m-Si (0.032 $/kWh, 4.34 $/kg). Therefore, the results demonstrates that p-Si is the most cost-effective and favorable technology for hydrogen production in the considered temperate climate. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper aims to assess the impact of solar and wind renewable energy (RE) potentials on the performance and economics of different RE systems located in Saudi Arabia and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula Countries (APC) to meet hydrogen, electrical, and thermal energy requirements. Techno-economic studies were carried out to evaluate the performance of a solar Photovoltaics (PV), a wind turbine (WT), and a hybrid solar/wind (PV/WT) system. The performance of different configurations of the considered systems are simulated and optimized in hourly basis at various locations in the APC region using a developed MATLAB computer code. The findings showed that the hybrid PV/WT system is more effective than PV or WT systems. In Riyadh, for the hybrid PV/WT system, Net Present Cost (NPC), Cost of Electricity (COE) and Cost of Hydrogen (COH) are 97.792 K$, 0.137 $/kWh and 2.01 $/kg, respectively. However, for the PV system, the findings showed that NPC, COE and COH increased by 30, 27 and 32%, respectively. For a standalone WT system NPC, COE and COH values increased by 53, 52, and 54%, respectively. In Saudi Arabia, it is obsereved that the minimum costs of both electricity and hydrogen productions are achieved for the hybrid standalone PV/WT system in Neom City with values of COE = 0.128 $/kWh and COH = 1.881 $/kg. For the APC region, the most cost-effective hybrid standalone PV/WT system is found in Kuwait City with COE = 0.120 $/kWh and COH = 1.765 $/kg. Furthermore, COE and COH contours of PV, WT, and PV/WT systems economics are developed which give the decision makers a full vision about solar and wind potentials in the region and identify the locations that minimize the cost of production. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts are promised to be extremely important in hydrogen generation of water electrolysis as one of the renewable energy technologies. However, low efficiency and high cost are two crucial barriers that hinder its development and application. Herein, we developed highly efficient NiFe-based self-supported electrocatalysts by a facile two-step electrodeposition method focusing on the porosification of a nickel foam (NF) substrate. The porous nickel layer (PN/NF) formed in the first step by dynamic hydrogen bubble template electrodeposition proved to be effective in facilitating the mass transfer process, and the following second step of nickel-iron deposition (NiFe/PN/NF) continued to increase the intrinsic catalytic activity, with the two synergistically contributing to the excellent OER performance. As an oxygen evolution electrode, it exhibits high catalytic activity in alkaline water electrolysis, which requires only an overpotential of 211 mV to promote the oxidation reaction of water. The overpotentials for the OER at 100, 500 and 750 mA cm−2 are as low as 244, 297 and 326 mV in 1 M KOH, respectively. In 6 M KOH, the overpotentials for driving electrolytic oxygen production at 100, 500, 750 and 1000 mA cm−2 are even lowered spectacularly to 133 mV, 178 mV, 193 mV and 208 mV, respectively. In particular, the catalyst showed a catalytic stability of more than 40 h at a current density of 500 mA cm−2, which presents it as a highly promising candidate for future large-scale industrial applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

However, the high investment costs and low energy efficiency of P2G systems pose challenges. This study designs a green hydrogen-based Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS) mode to improve the economic efficiency of P2G systems. In this ESaaS mode, the P2G system acts as an energy trading hub. The ESaaS operator manages the system and enables microgrids to access energy storage services. In return, the ESaaS operator generates revenue through electricity and hydrogen trading. To characterize stakeholders' behaviors, we develop a cost-minimizing model for multi-energy microgrid operation and a revenue-maximizing model for P2G investment and operation. To coordinate stakeholders involved in cooperation, we employ Nash bargaining-based model reformulation to determine investment and operation decisions and benefit distribution. Then, logarithm transformation and trading price discretization are introduced to efficiently solve the non-convex and nonlinear reformulated model. Simulation experiments using Shanghai's electricity market and meteorological data demonstrate that the ESaaS mode achieves 100% recovery of surplus renewable electricity and increases the proportion of renewable energy in microgrids from 59% to 83%. The results suggest that green hydrogen-based ESaaS is a feasible solution to increase the utilization rate of renewable energy and bring considerable economic and environmental benefits to all stakeholders. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The use of fuel cells (FCs) for combined power/heat generation is a promising solution to mitigate energy/environmental issues and to manage the uncertainty associated with renewable sources’ power generation. This work systematically reviews the previous works regarding the integration of FC with different hybrid renewable/storage systems to meet the load combinations (electric/thermal and electric/thermal/cooling load combinations) of different energy sectors (including residential, commercial, industrial, institutional, and agricultural sectors) under uncertainties and environmental effects. Both stand-alone and grid-connected operation modes under different kinds of renewable sources and storage systems of different types are reviewed. Additionally, the pros/cons of the previous works and the key findings of this review work are discussed. The literature indicates that the high investment cost of FCs can be justified by integrating them with renewable/storage systems to reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and payback period for the investment cost, and also to increase the renewable fraction, particularly for remote and/or combined loads. The reported LCOE is within 0.0462–1.0864 $/kWh, LPSP is within 0–20%, the payback period is more than 6 years on average, and the renewable fraction is within 26.77%–100% based on the related case study. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The advancement of highly-active bifunctional electrocatalysts towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for reducing costs and improving efficiency. Phosphides, as the representative of bifunctional catalysts, can be used for HER and OER by virtue of the special metal/phosphorus coordination mode and the ordered surface reconstruction. However, the inappropriate adsorption/desorption energy for intermediates, poor reaction kinetics and scant activation analysis limit their large-scale application. Here, we developed a novel Ni/Co phosphide multi-component heterostructure catalyst on Ni foam (Co2P/NixPy@NF) through hydrothermal treatment and low temperature phosphorization. Benefitting from open hierarchical structures, abundant active sites, rapid mass/charge transfer rates, and modified electronic structures, the optimal catalyst exhibits excellent activity and high stability towards HER (155 mV overpotential in 1.0 M KOH and 175 mV overpotential in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 100 mA·cm−2), OER (300 mV in 1.0 M KOH at 100 mA·cm−2), and overall water electrolysis (1.74 V cell voltage in 1.0 M KOH at 100 mA·cm−2). Post-stability analysis further reveals that hydroxide and oxyhydroxide are generated on catalysts' surfaces during HER and OER, respectively, in alkaline electrolytes. These activation processes result in the catalysts' surfaces forming new heterostructures which reorganize the electronic structure. These morphology optimizations, heterostructure engineering and investigation of activation reported here have been effective strategies for designing and exploring hybrid materials as fabulous catalysts to generate renewable energy. © 2023},

	abstract = {In a 100% renewable energy scenario, power generation fluctuates, requiring management and control of this generation. Storage is presented as a solution to regulate production discontinuity. In particular, seasonal storage can compensate for long-term fluctuations and serve as a necessary complement to short-term storage management. Due to the potential role of hydrogen in the decarbonization of energy production systems, this research attempts to analyse the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of this energy carrier as a solution to long-term electricity requirements. The research focuses on the analysis of the total Power-to-Power (P2P) process cost, all factors affecting the input of electricity up to the output of electricity after the conversion of the hydrogen are considered. A transformation of the surplus electricity to hydrogen through a PEM electrolyzer is proposed in this paper. This hydrogen would be stored seasonally in salt caverns. Finally, a gas-to-energy transformation using gas turbines or fuel cells is contemplated. The analysis presents highly competitive results in terms of cost, demonstrating the system's competitiveness and potential: the turbine powered by 100% hydrogen solution appears to be more cost effective than the fuel cell solution: 0.207€/kWh and 0.284€/kWh respectively. Hydrogen storage presents itself as the most cost-effective long-term alternative in the near future, even better than pumped hydro, compressed air or batteries. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {An alkaline electrolyzer is a traditional equipment to generate hydrogen. Improving the yield of electrolyzers has recently captured much attention. In this regard, the utilization of carbon-coated nanomaterial structures is a state-of-art method. On the other hand, considering the current crisis of fossil energies, the exploitation of renewables and green technologies is necessary and unavoidable. Additionally, the design and development of integrated energy systems with two or more output products and the maximum usage of thermal losses to enhance productivity can increase the flexibility and acceptability of the energy system. In this regard, the current paper develops a framework for the performance of a new solar and biomass energies-driven multigeneration system (MGS). The main units installed in MGS are three electric energy generation units based on a gas turbine process, a solid oxide fuel cell unit (SOFCU) and an organic Rankine cycle unit (ORCU), a biomass energy conversion unit to useful thermal energy, a seawater conversion unit into useable freshwater, a unit for converting water and electricity into hydrogen energy and oxygen gas via a nanomaterial-based alkaline electrolyzer, a unit for converting solar energy into useful thermal energy (based on Fresnel collector), and a cooling load generation unit. The planned MGS has a novel structure and layout that has not been considered by researchers in previous papers. The current article is based on presenting a multi-aspect evaluation in order to investigate thermodynamic-conceptual, environmental and exergoeconomic analyzes. The outcomes indicated that the planned MGS can produce about 6.31 MW of electrical power and 0.49 MW of thermal power. Furthermore, MGS is able to produce various products such as potable water (∼0.977 kg/s), cooling load (∼0.16 MW), hydrogen energy (∼1.578 g/s) and sanitary water (∼0.957 kg/s). The overall energy and exergy productivities were measured as 78.13% and 47.72%, respectively. Also, the total investment and unit exergy costs were 47.16 USD per hour and 11.07 USD per GJ, respectively. Further, the content of carbon dioxide released from the planned system was equal to 10.59 kmol per MWh. A parametric study has been also developed to identify influencing parameters. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Shared energy storage is widely recognized as an energy hub for the coordinated operation of regional integrated energy systems (RIESs). Multi-energy systems (MESs) share centralized energy storage to store excess renewable energy sources (RESs). This paper proposes a novel energy-sharing framework considering hydrogen trading, which is suitable for residential, industrial, and commercial RIES structures. Shared energy storage operator (SESO) promotes hydrogen energy transactions by formulating time-of-use (TOU) hydrogen prices. The proposed hydrogen energy trading method can be regarded as a master-client structure, and a hierarchical optimal scheduling method based on the Stackelberg game relationship is designed. Finally, a case study is performed based on an optimal scheduling algorithm combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The cases show the electricity‑hydrogen shared energy storage mechanism in RIESs can improve the RESs utilization rate and effectively reduce the operating costs of each system. Moreover, compared with RIESs with a single centralized electric energy storage, the TOU hydrogen price mechanism can further lower the energy prices and improve the economy of the RIES. The cases show that hydrogen energy sharing reduces the operating cost of RIES by 9.96% and increases the regional energy utilization rate by 2.97%. And the shared energy storage business model can satisfy the economy of both SESO and RIES. It confirms the rationality of the electric hydrogen shared energy storage project. © 2023},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel stochastic risk-averse mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for optimal electricity procurement of hydrogen fuel stations (HFSs) with responsive hydrogen demands. In the developed model, HFS operator may procure its required electricity through day-ahead (DA) market, bilateral contracts, a contract with withdrawal penalty (CWP) and balancing market. The HFS is committed to inject a pre-specified volume of hydrogen into a natural gas network. In the developed stochastic model, the uncertainties in hydrogen demand and DA market prices are characterized as random variables and modeled as scenarios. The developed model is a two-stage model in which the decisions on transactions with bilateral contracts are the first-stage decision variables and the other decision variables belong to the second stage. The risk of suffering from high procurement costs is modeled using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). The results confirm the efficiency of the proposed model both in terms of reduction in HFS expected cost and risk alleviation. The results show that the transaction through bilateral contracts decreases the expected cost and CVaR respectively by 6% and 3%. The results also indicate that the participation in the balancing market decreases the expected cost and CVaR respectively by 6% and 1.6%. As per results, in scenarios in which DA market prices are lower than CWP prices, HFS operator prefers to pay a penalty fee and withdraw from CWP. The sensitivity of HFS profit to the weight factor of risk metric and the participation factor of responsive demands are assessed. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

On-site “mother” stations produce hydrogen from city natural gas or water electrolysis, and off-site “daughter” stations are supplied with hydrogen from nearby on-site stations. This HRS system is a micro hydrogen supply chain that includes hydrogen suppliers, retailers, and end consumers characterized via demand functions. The present paper designs an optimal business model for this distributed HRS system using a multi-level game model, given that on-site and off-site HRS can operate individually or as a coalition to supply hydrogen. Stackelberg game and Shapley value models are constructed to explore how cooperative operation is superior by generating more profits than separate operation. Accordingly, in order to promote cooperation between on-site and off-site operators of HRS, an evolutionary game model is developed to investigate the allocation of profits and coordinated costs on the equilibrium of cooperative operation. The authors conclude that boosting the initial probabilities of actors to choose cooperative strategies and decreasing the coordinated cost can lead the game system to the ideal consequence. The present paper offers recommendations including establishing regulation standards for HRS operation, and advancing the information technology to design a more effective cooperative mechanism. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The energy sources that are used intensively in vehicles are generally non-renewable energy sources and they are in danger of being depleted as demand increases. To deal with this, countries are turning to hydrogen, which is considered a clean and renewable energy source. For hydrogen to be widespread, the Hydrogen Supply Chain (HSC) should be planned effectively. There are three key issues associated with an HSC. First, the uncertainty of future demand makes it difficult to design an HSC. Second, considering only the cost can bring along many other problems. One should also consider the associated risk and CO2 emission as well. Third, in addition to the steady state of HSC, the transition of the HSC throughout periods is also important. In this study, a multi-objective, multi-period stochastic model is proposed to address these three issues. The results show that facilities having low CO2 emission are opened in northern region of Turkey because of H2S sources in Black Sea and they serve the center and the eastern regions.

	abstract = {Efficient electrocatalysts are indispensable for promoting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Existing electrocatalysts are limited by sluggish HER kinetics, higher over potential leading to greater energy demand, instability over time, and low tolerance to impurities. These challenges lead to a lower solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 2.46% using MoS2 electrocatalyst in authors’ previous research work. Mixed metal oxide/conducting polymer nanocomposites have shown great potential for use in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reactors due to their high surface area, excellent catalytic activity, and stability in acidic and alkaline environments. A major requirement for suitable electrocatalyst is a low overpotential for hydrogen evolution, a high tolerance to impurities and a long-term durability which makes it more efficient than traditional electrocatalysts. With this brief background, the present work focuses on the application of CuO/TiO2/Polyindole (CTPIN) nanocomposite synthesized with the help of two-step process involving microemulsion and oxidative polymerization techniques. The resulting material was characterized using miscellaneous physicochemical techniques. HRTEM analysis clearly demonstrates the formation of CTPIN nanocatalysts with ultrasmall particle sizes of 10–30 nm. The nickel strip was coated with CTPIN nanoparticles was used as cathode for generating solar hydrogen through membraneless electrochemical water splitting. Membraneless electrolyzers offer a promising and cost-effective substitute to traditional electrolyzers, enabling efficient electrochemical hydrogen generation. At a radiation intensity of 320 W/m2 and under normal working conditions, the CTPIN nanocomposite demonstrated a solar-to-hydrogen generation efficiency of 3.43% which is greater than previous results obtained using MoS2. The CTPIN electrocatalyst has a high potential for electrocatalytic solar hydrogen generation.

This barge has a challenging navigational route in the Nile River from Alexandria to Aswan and vice versa. It is scheduled to complete 30 trips annually while carrying 850 tons/trip. The system is based on photovoltaic panels, and was selected with its excess energy to be stored primarily in the form of H2 gas through electrolysis, and batteries (i.e. Power to Gas technology) to be later converted back to electrical energy through fuel cells. Hence, an operation algorithm was formulated to optimize the performance of the system by defining operating modes that use solar energy, hydrogen energy, batteries, or hybrid energy coming from multiple sources that result in an internal rate of return (IRR) of 15.1% and overall efficiency of 57.9%. This high efficiency is due to the nature of water current that flows from south to north of Egypt, therefore, causing a significant reduction in power demand in the trip from Aswan to Alexandria that requires 11,980 kW h, compared to the trip from Alexandria to Aswan that requires 21,064 kW h. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Water electrolysis coupled with renewable electricity systems is one of the most promising ways that will contribute to making the energy transition toward zero carbon emissions possible. This study aims to perform a technical-economic analysis of large-scale hydrogen production facilities through the simulation and optimization of hybrid renewable energy systems that use wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. Five Moroccan cities are subjected to the approach. The PV/wind ratio, net present cost, Levelized cost of hydrogen, storage capacity, and water desalination cost are analyzed. The results show that combining photovoltaic panels and wind turbines helps produce low-cost hydrogen in Morocco, especially in Dakhla with 2.54$/kg. It's the lowest cost in Morocco compared to previous studies. The results also show the importance of using hydrogen tanks to store energy. Finally, the cost of water desalination can be neglected, as it only represents between 0.12% and 0.35% of the net present costs. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a Techno-Economic Assessment (TEA) on present and future scenarios of different energy storage technologies comprising hydrogen and batteries: Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), Hydrogen Energy Storage System (H2ESS), and Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). These three configurations were assessed for different time horizons: 2019, 2022 and 2030, under both on-grid and off-grid conditions. For 2030, a sensitivity analysis under different energy scenarios was performed, covering other trends in on-grid electric consumption and prices, CO2 taxation and the evolution of hydrogen technology prices from 2019 until 2030. The selected case study is the Research Park Zellik (RPZ), a CO2-neutral sustainable Local Energy Community (LEC) in Zellik, Belgium. The software HOMER (Hybrid Optimisation Model for Electric Renewable) has been selected to design, model and optimise the defined case study. The results showed that BESS was the most competitive when the electric grid was available among the three possible storage options. Additionally, HESS was overall more competitive than H2ESS-only, regardless of the grid connection mode. Finally, as per HESS, hydrogen was proved to play a complementary role when combined with batteries, enhancing the flexibility of the microgrid and enabling deeper decarbonisation by reducing the electricity bought from the grid, increasing renewable energy production and balancing toward an island operating mode. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The transformation of economies worldwide towards climate neutrality will require not only renewable electricity but also climate-neutral energy carriers such as hydrogen and its derivatives. The production cost of electric fuels (e-fuels) are to a large extent driven by the energy-intensive electrolytic water splitting. The option of producing e-fuels in highly industrialized countries, as Germany, competes with production at international locations, with excellent conditions for renewable energies and thus very low levelized cost of green hydrogen and its derivatives. In this paper, we examine the economic efficiency of various imported e-fuels that are under consideration in different scenarios for the year 2035: Fischer-Tropsch diesel, methanol, and hydrogen transported as cryogenic liquid or in form of liquid organic hydrogen carriers. We develop a mathematical model that covers the entire process chain, from the production of the e-fuels at various excellent locations worldwide to the energetic utilization of the fuels in a heavy duty vehicle. We find that the choice of production site has a major impact on the mobility cost using the respective fuels. Under the selected boundary conditions and assumptions, methanol, cryogenic hydrogen, and liquid organic hydrogen carriers are the most favourable options for all seven locations examined. Which e-fuel is cheapest varies with the production site. Especially in case of diesel, the levelized cost of electricity determined by the full load hours of the applied renewable energy source have a huge impact. An LOHC-based system is shown to be less dependent on electricity source compared to other technologies due to its comparatively low electricity consumption. The length of the transportation route and the price of the filling station infrastructure, however, increase mobility cost for LOHC and LH2. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, this work proposes an energy model to replace the Spanish vehicle fleet by hydrogen-fueled vehicles by 2050. Thus, six regions are defined according to their proximity to regasification plants, where hydrogen generation hubs are implemented. Likewise, renewables deployment is subject to their land availability. Hydrogen is transported through an overhauled primary natural gas transport network, while two distribution methods are compared for levelized cost of hydrogen minimization: gaseous pipeline vs liquid hydrogen supply in trucks. Hence, a capacity of 443.1 GW of renewables, 214 GW of electrolyzers and 3.45 TWh of hydrogen storage is required nationwide. Additionally, gaseous hydrogen distribution is on average 17% cheaper than liquid hydrogen delivery. Finally, all the regions present lower prices per km traveled than gasoline or diesel. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The excessive production of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse effect, and the resulting global warming due to the use of fossil fuels have prompted governments, industry, and researchers toward renewable and clean energy sources. Hydrogen has emerged as a novel carbon neutral energy carrier with the highest specific energy content. Production, storage, distribution, and utilization of hydrogen are rapidly increasing. In this context, the use of hydrogen in power plants, fuel cells and internal combustion engines is constantly being developed. However, widespread use of hydrogen requires its sustainable production at low cost and under high purity conditions, which is the subject of further research. Hydrogen separation using membrane reactors is not a new concept; however, it has gained special attention in the last decades and represents a relevant and promising option to potentially overcome the above mentioned problems. This review examines advances in industry and research in hydrogen utilization, hydrogen production using membrane reactors, the nature and physicochemical properties of membranes, and the various configurations of membrane reactors. The effects of membrane reactors on the interplay of temperature, pressure, reactant conversion, hydrogen production, and thermodynamic equilibrium are explained, and the results are compared with those of conventional reactors. Finally, fuel cells, solar collectors, and their integrability into membrane reactors are discussed. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The electricity production from Renewable Energy (RE) in isolated locations requires long-term energy storage systems. To that end, Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESS), through a combination of hydrogen and batteries, can benefit from the different advantages of both technologies. This paper presents a hybrid Power-to-Power (PtP) Optimal Power Dispatch (OPD) model for isolated systems with no electric grid access. Currently, the electricity supply in such cases is usually based on a mix of RE as the primary energy source sustained by a diesel genset acting as a backup generator. In this context, the model delivers the hourly energy flows between renewable production sources, energy storage devices and the electrical load, which minimises costs and Green House Gases (GHG) emissions. For validation purposes, the model was tested through its application to a case study in an isolated area in the Canary Islands, Spain. The results show that the algorithm calculates the hourly OPD successfully for a given plant sizing, considering the defined operational states of the different assets. These operational constraints showed a decrease in the PtP round-trip efficiency of 5.4% and a reduction of the hydrogen production of 9.7%. Finally, the techno-economic analysis of the results proves that the combination of hydrogen and batteries with RE production is a feasible alternative to phasing out fossil fuels for the selected case study – reducing the diesel generator usage down to 1.2% of the yearly energy supply. © 2023 The Authors},

While the literature has almost exclusively focused on energy systems implications in the Global North, the types and distribution of economic benefits of trading renewable energy in the Global South are not well-understood. Here, we develop a multi-objective linear program to derive least cost pathways of gradually diversifying renewable e-fuel trade, such as hydrogen and methanol, and apply it to the case of e-fuel trade between Africa and Europe. Using a country-level Gini-coefficient approach to model the equality of per capita economic value adds, the model yields Pareto-optimal system configurations that distribute the economic benefits of decarbonization more equally in different African countries, and at the same time, diversify the source of such fuels for more robust global renewable energy trade. We find that the cost-optimal configuration concentrates e-fuel production in only a few African countries. But reducing the unequal distribution of economic value add by half increases system cost by less than 10%, and is possible at low production costs (less than 1 USD/kg for renewable methanol and less than 4 USD/kg for renewable hydrogen). Our results thus point towards cost-efficient pathways for decision makers to increase African and European renewable energy security by distributing its production across more African countries. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Designing self-sufficient renewable energy systems is becoming a key issue in the energy sector due to modern energy goals. Due to the variability of renewable energy sources, very often it is necessary to adopt hybrid configurations of renewable energy systems and advanced energy storage to achieve self-sufficiency. However, the adoption of complex and novel systems, including technologies as photovoltaic, wind turbines, biomass gasifiers, hydrogen energy storage, must to be founded on a comprehensive analysis of the system operation under different conditions and its energy and economic performance in the investigated case study. Therefore, the aim of the present paper is carry out a comprehensive feasibility analysis of a novel hybrid renewable energy system achieving a high self-sufficiency level. The system integrates a wind turbine and photovoltaic panels to match the energy load of a tourist resort in Agkistro, Greece. Energy exceeding the load is directed to the energy storage system based on the battery and hydrogen tank. As backup energy source, a wood gasifier is used. The investigation is performed by means of a numerical model developed in TRNSYS software allowing one to simulate dynamically the system and to assess its energy and economic performance. The goal achieved during the simulation of the system was to ensure at least 97% of energy demand from renewable sources. Moreover, a parametric analysis of the storage system is presented. It is found that payback period of the installation varies in the range between 11 and 15 years, for systems configurations allowing to satisfy 90–98% of the users energy yearly demand from renewables. The achieved results allows one to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system from both an energy and economic point of view. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The proposed microgrid system incorporates solar photovoltaic, wind turbines, biomass gasifier, fuel cell, and Battery storage. The sizing of each component is determined through the utilization of real local meteorological data and the load demand over a year, employing the Levy flight-salp swarm algorithms (LF-SSA). The optimization objective is to minimize the annualized system cost (ASC) of the HRES, while also considering the reliability constraint of Loss of power supply probability (LPSP). The comparative outcomes demonstrate that the LF-SSA surpasses other examined algorithms, namely the salp swarm, genetic algorithm, and HOMER software by achieving substantial cost savings of $29033, $50796, $191771 respectively in relation to the proposed HRES. The result further shows that, the LF-SSA provides the lowest LCOE of $0.933162/kWh, in contrast to SSA at $0.947737/kWh, GA at $0.958660/kWh, and HOMER at $1.075351/kWh.

	abstract = {This study aims to evaluate a green hydrogen (H2) based hybrid energy system (HES) from solar and wind renewable energy sources. The proposed HES contains PV panels, wind turbines and a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer. Meteorology data such as solar radiation, temperature and wind speed were obtained from Atilim University Incek Campus Meteorology Station (Ankara, Turkey). The designed HES has been examined as both grid-connected and off-grid. In the grid-connected system, the electricity requirement of the load is supplied by the sun and wind, and the surplus energy produced is stored by producing H2 using an electrolyzer. In the off-grid HES, the electricity requirement of the load is completely provided by the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). In this system, the electrolyzer produces the H2 needed by the PEMFC with the energy provided by solar and wind energy. According to the results, 20,186 kWh of energy is produced annually in the on-grid and 3273 sm3 of H2 is stored. The off-grid system is investigated for Design-1 and Design-2 using two different wind turbine (WT) rated power. In Design-1 and Design-2, annually 95,145 kWh and 83,511 kWh of energy are produced annually 17,942 sm3 and 14,370 sm3 H2 are stored, respectively. When the on-grid and off-grid systems are examined; levelized cost of energy (LCOE) was calculated as 0.223 $/kWh for the on-grid system and 0.416 $/kWh and 0.410 $/kWh for Design-1 and Design-2 for off-grid systems, respectively. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

These systems have been developed, simulated, and optimized for techno-economic feasibility, taking into consideration the electricity demand profile, geographic regions, and climatic data. A sensitivity analysis has been conducted to determine the most economical systems for producing 0.90079 MWh of energy per day. Simulation results show that the net present cost of the grid-connected hybrid system is between M$ 1.536859 and M$ 6.818162, while the cost of energy is between $ 0.155 and $ 0.3749 per kWh. The fuel cell -wind turbine system incurs a maximum energy cost of $ 0.3749/kWh. The solar and grid-connected hybrid systems offers the lowest net present cost and cost of energy, which are M$ 1.536859 and $ 0.155/kWh, respectively. The research findings suggest that utilizing photovoltaic, wind, and fuel cells is a more feasible and economical strategy due to system benefits. The study also showed the viability and efficiency of using solar and wind resources for hydrogen production and power generation.

Since the scarcity and high cost diminish the commercial use of noble metal catalysts, this study utilizes environmental friendly, stable, and cost-effective nickel cobalt over reduced graphene oxide electrocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities at low overpotential to give benchmark density of 10 mAcm−2. Among the synthesized nanocomposites rGO-NiCo10% and rGO-NiCo15% showed enhanced oxygen evolution reaction activity producing a current density of 80 mAcm−2 and 50 mAcm−2 at overpotential 620 mV with low Tafel slopes 123.27 mVdec−1 and 141.41 mVdec-1 respectively, comparing to activity of RuO2. Similarly, they produced a current density of 20.5 mAcm−2 and 13.1 mAcm−2 at overpotential 490 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction with low Tafel slope values 67.67 mVdec−1 and 92.79 mVdec−1.

	abstract = {The increasing demand for renewable energy sources and the presence of organic pollutants in water are pressing issues that require sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions. Electrocatalytic water splitting, and water detoxification offer promising approaches to address these challenges, but current electrocatalysts often suffer from low efficiency and pH-specificity, which limits their practical application. In this study, we synthesized low-cost, effective aluminum sulfoselenide (Al2SSe) nanorods as electro- and photocatalysts for water splitting that works in wide range of pH and water detoxification. Characterization of the Al2SSe nanorods using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques confirmed their shape and crystallinity. Subsequent testing of the Al2SSe catalyst in three different electrolytes revealed excellent performance in both light and dark conditions for both the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In particular, the Al2SSe catalyst displayed low overpotentials and small tafel slopes of 32 mV/dec, 42 mV/dec, 49 mV/dec, and 91 mV/dec for the OER and 31.4 mV/dec, 34 mV/dec, 45 mV/dec and 56 mV/dec for the HER in 1 M potassium hydroxide (KOH), 0.1 M sulfuric acid (H2SO4), 0.1 M perchloric acid (HClO4) and 1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) electrolytes, respectively, under light conditions. The Al2SSe photocatalyst was also found to be highly effective at degrading 89% of Congo Red. These findings suggest that post-transition metal chalcogenides such as Al2SSe may have significant potential for use in electro- and photocatalytic applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper presents a techno-economic feasibility study exploring the Levelized Cost of in-situ green hydrogen production in Mexican refineries. With hydrogen comprising over 90% of national consumption in the petrochemical industry, the research analyzes the renewable energy potential of Mexico to sustain hydrogen production in six operational refineries and the recently inaugurated Dos Bocas refinery. The study outlines the potential for green hydrogen production, transportation, and storage, emphasizing its application in petrochemical processes over short, medium, and long-term transitions to green, sustainable hydrogen production. The study reveals significant results, with the Salamanca refinery demonstrating the most competitive cost for solar PV energy production. Additionally, the Salina Cruz refinery proves to have the most competitive energy cost for wind power production, followed closely by Dos Bocas. Furthermore, the research indicates that as solar PV technology costs continue to decrease, the use of solar PV could result in cheaper green H2 even in regions with abundant wind resources like Salina Cruz. The study also shows that a grid-interconnected Power-to-Gas (P2G) system can have a reduction on the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH), owed to income generated from energy exportation. This scheme must be further analyzed as a way to increase competitiveness of power to gas systems; even as a mean to indirectly subsidize the operational costs of the green H2 plant during the initial phase of a new project for a refinery. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential for in-situ green hydrogen production and its economic viability within Mexico's petrochemical industry. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Carbon neutrality is one of the main goals in current power system planning and operation. Many different actions and solutions are presented and implemented so far, incorporating renewable energy sources at all levels of the system. With the raising prices of natural gas and its negative impact on the environment, particularly emphasised over the past two years, new technologies and energy vectors are emerging as potential for its replacement. High importance of the hydrogen energy vector, especially in the decarbonisation of the industry sector, is being put forward due to its advantages of zero greenhouse gas emissions, its capacity for storing energy and capability to balance the production of renewable energy sources. This paper brings a detailed mathematical model of a price driven, demand responsive, multi-energy industry facility, as a logic first implementer of hydrogen technologies due to its high and multi-energy consumption nature. The systematic analyses are conducted over a set of scenarios of local production, considering different hydrogen technologies as well as range of natural gas and electricity prices. The findings of the paper conclude that hydrogen technology implementation into a realistic industrial consumers processes results in zero local emissions production, high level of autonomy and resistance from the market disturbances. When compared with classic industrial layouts, the overall CO2 footprint is reduced from around 30% to around 85%, depending on the scenario. The sensitivity analysis has proven that hydrogen layouts are comparable to natural gas layouts in terms of total costs, showing that hydrogen options result in lower cost in the range from 25% to 58%, depending on the observed scenario. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources are unquestionably required, given that the world's energy consumption is anticipated to increase significantly in the next decades. Besides, fuel cell converts chemical energy directly into electricity, making it the most efficient and environmentally friendly power source. This study examines the viability of producing electricity using a supercritical CO2 cycle, a methane digester, and a gas turbine. Applying the principles of exergetic balance, mass, energy conservation, and component-specific exergetic balance to each part of the power unit allow for a simulation of the power unit's efficiency. Furthermore, a parametric analysis is performed to establish how the relevant factors will affect the unit's functioning. The optimization algorithms are generated with the help of deep learning methods. It was found that the ratio of the compressor's pressure to the current density was the most crucial element in determining output power. Nanoparticles are used in fuel cells to enhance heat transfer and, thus, the generated power. Through optimization, one might find a product that is both the most cost-effective and energy-efficient option available. Artificial neural networks may be used as a mediator to help expedite the process of reaching optimum performance across several criteria. The optimal settings for the planned power plant are now being determined by studying the correlation between design factors and objective functions. Therefore, the second law's efficiency at its sweet spot was calculated at 61.8%. In the end, the system at its optimum point was found to have an exergo-environmental index of 0.436. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In addition, the fuel known for leaving no trails of harmful emissions by combustion and emits only water as a by-product. Algal biomass has emerged as a potential feedstock for biohydrogen production. The objectives of the present article is to illustrate the various ways of algal biohydrogen production along with mechanisms and challenges of biohydrogen production in which factors controlling the hydrogen production process and challenges in the economic aspect, technical aspect and storage are considered. Future road map of biohydrogen from algae is also delineated in view of decarbonization pathway and respective SWOT analysis pointing strength, weakness, opportunities and threats. Key strength of algal biohydrogen is identified as excellent carbon capture and waste valorization capability of algae to promote zero-waste circular bioeconomy. Along with these, some weaknesses of this biological approach include technological hinderances leading low biohydrogen yield and high initial cost investment. Implementing genetic/metabolic or environmental manipulations has shown promising opportunity to improve algal biohydrogen to ensure long-term sustainability.

The simultaneous electricity, heat, and hot water generation of these two when coupled with an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) installed within a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) was studied. Additionally, to utilize the electricity generated from various parts of the process; i.e. the fuel cell, organic Rankine cycle turbine, and the thermoelectric generator, the reverse osmosis (OR) water desalination unit was coupled to the process. The aforementioned system was studied and analyzed based on thermodynamic and thermos-economic aspects. A parametric study was also carried out to analyze the effect of main factors on power output, energy/exergy yield, and the total cost of each system. Finally, a dual objective optimization was achieved by taking the main factors into consideration and using a genetic algorithm. Results indicated that the work generated by the system was not significant; however, the amount of hot water produced was relatively promising. Based on exergy and exergoeconomic evaluation, the After-Burner is an important non-renewable energy source while the fuel cell has a higher inefficiency cost which could be due to low work generation. Results indicate that the moisture in the biomass and the figure of merit, are important parameters that have to be kept as low as possible. The energy yield of the fuel cell was calculated to be 45.05%.

	abstract = {The transition towards carbon-free transportation is only possible by the adoption of renewable energy alternatives. Hydrogen-based transportation is an attractive option considering the availability of the required refuelling infrastructure. A well-established network of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is important for the widespread commercialization of fuel-cell electric vehicles. The most expensive H2 refuelling components originate from hydrogen compression. Due to their ability to run on solar thermal energy, a metal hydride hydrogen compressor is used in this study. In this communication, the aim is to present a study on solar thermal based hydrogen compressors for a hydrogen refuelling station. An analytical study is presented on the energy assessment of a metal hydride compressor by considering three candidate pairs of metal hydrides (Pair 1: Ti0.95Zr0.05Cr0.8Mn0.8V0.2Ni0.2/Ti0.8Zr0.2Cr0.95Fe0.95V0.1; Pair 2: TiCr1.55Mn0.2Fe0.2/Ti0.9Zr0.1Mn1.4Cr0.35V0.2Fe0.05, Pair 3: La0.35Ce0.45Ca0.2Ni4.95Al0.05/Ti0.8Zr0.2Cr0.95Fe0.95V0.1) to achieve refuelling pressure of 700 bar. The variation in thermal efficiency of the compressor and thermal energy requirements with changes in heat source temperature, supply pressure and heat losses are presented. Furthermore, the economics of three pairs of alloys for high-pressure compression is compared. It was found that Ti0.95Zr0.05Cr0.8Mn0.8V0.2Ni0.2/Ti0.8Zr0.2Cr0.95Fe0.95V0.1 pair has the maximum compressor efficiency of 7.2% at supply pressure and heat source temperature of 25 bar and 150 °C, respectively.

Coupling a green energy source (e.g., photovoltaic, wind) with fuel cells and hydrogen storage satisfied the dynamic energy consumption and dynamic hydrogen demand for both the civilian and military mobility sectors. To make the military sector independent of its civilian counterpart, a military site was connected to a renewable energy hub. This made it possible to develop a stand-alone green-energy system, transform the military site into a positive energy hub, and achieve autonomous energy operation for several days or weeks. An environmental and economic assessment was conducted to determine the carbon footprint and the economic viability.

To reduce carbon emissions, the environmental cost from the hydrogen supply chain network and electric power system is jointly minimized with the operational cost of IHTES. To consider the timeliness of hydrogen deliveries, hydrogen transport via tube trailers is innovatively modeled as an extended vehicle routing problem with time windows, and delays are penalized. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem so that it can be efficiently solved using the branch-and-cut method. Case studies illustrate and validate the proposed model, and demonstrate the computational efficiency of our approach. Carbon emissions are reduced by 47.8% when the emission cost is co-optimized with the operational cost.

For systems with significant seasonal imbalance between energy production and demand, it may be necessary to integrate seasonal storage in order to achieve fully decarbonized operation. This paper develops a novel model predictive control strategy for a renewable microgrid with seasonal hydrogen storage. The strategy relies on data-based prediction of the energy production and consumption of an industrial power plant and finds optimized energy flows using a digital twin optimizer. To enable seasonal operation, incentives for long-term energy shifts are provided by assigning a cost value to the storage charge and adding it to the optimization target function. A hybrid control scheme based on rule-based heuristics compensates for imperfect predictions. With only 6% oversizing compared to the optimal system layout, the strategy manages to deliver enough energy to meet all demand while achieving balanced hydrogen production and consumption throughout the year. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The factors such as solar irradiation, electrolyzer design, catalysts, and operational parameters impacts the energy efficiency and hydrogen production rates. The strategies include coupling PV arrays and electrolyzers with DC/DC converters with MPPT to maximize power output.

	abstract = {The environmental pollution and energy crisis caused by the excessive consumption of fossil fuels have prompted a more urgent demand for the development of clean energy. As a carbon-free clean energy carrier, the sustainable production of hydrogen (H2) is a key step in the future decarbonization of the planet. Among many methods of hydrogen production, water electrolysis using renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind) can enable the generation of high-purity H2 in a low-carbon economy, which favors the alleviation of environmental and energy problems. In the past decades, water electrolysis has been dominated by alkaline water electrolysis, however, the oxidation and reduction reactions of water in conventional water electrolysis are closely coupled in space and time, which introduces challenges for the separation of gas products and the utilization of renewable energy. Herein, low-cost Na0.44MnO2 was chosen as solid-state redox mediator to decouple the evolution of H2 and O2 in alkaline electrolyte and obtain high-purity H2 without using any separator (membrane) or purification step. As an intermediate carrier for charge storage, the energy efficiency and decoupling efficiency can reach 98.7% and 97%, respectively, at constant current of 1.3 mA/cm2. Furthermore, we achieved flexible production of high-purity H2 by directly driving decoupled water electrolysis using intermittent renewable energy sources, confirming the potentially practical application of Na0.44MnO2. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {With rapid industrialization, rising fossil fuel consumption, and environmental concerns, developing clean and green energy is an inescapable option. Hydrogen has emerged as a significant potential energy carrier and a viable future replacement fuel for fossil fuels due to its renewable and pollution-free properties. Previous review papers have significantly contributed to the body of literature on the various technologies for producing hydrogen by revealing key insights into their working principles and conditions, as well as the economic and environmental aspects. In addition, they also highlighted the potential pathways to enable the application of these technologies in the context of carbon neutrality. However, these studies have not broken down the evolutionary patterns and developmental progress of either fossil fuel-based or renewable energy-based technologies used to produce hydrogen. In addition, the currently available literature does not contain the most recent research that focuses on the evolution and life cycle of each technology category from a chronological point of view. The key drivers, countries/regions, and their contributions to the field's development have received little attention. As a result, it is critical to monitor technological advances in hydrogen energy production and investigate the key enablers of these advancements. Against this backdrop, the current study employs patent analysis tools to achieve four primary goals: (1) to track the development trends in the field of hydrogen production from 2000 to 2019; (2) to identify and compare the recent development trends in the last five years according to the feedstock, i.e., fossil fuel, water, and biomass-based technologies; (3) to predict the technology life cycle of the two main groups of hydrogen production technologies (fossil and renewable); (4) to identify and compare the key drivers of hydrogen production technologies from a statistical standpoint. The findings of the study may aid in identifying technical prospects in the field of fossil and renewable-based hydrogen production, and decision-makers may use them as a reference in developing a strategic plan for future technological growth. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is expected to be a key fuel in the global energy transition. It is characterised by diverse potential applications in the industrial, transport, energy and building sectors. An increase of hydrogen production from renewable energy (RES) is especially important from the point of view of further sustainable development. However, a dominant share of hydrogen production is still covered by steam methane reforming (SMR). In order to facilitate the increase of the share of H2 from RES, efficiency of various hydrogen production technologies should be properly assessed. Majority of scientific publications consider only the local energy efficiency of the hydrogen production methods. From this perspective the production of hydrogen by SMR is characterised by higher efficiency than production of hydrogen from RES. In order to properly evaluate the global efficiency of hydrogen production technologies, we propose an advanced system exergy analysis – Thermo-Ecological Cost (TEC). Additionally, we propose to consider the production of hydrogen via electrolysis as cogeneration of two useful products - hydrogen and oxygen. Such approach allows to decompose the energy expenditure for the process and assign a lower burden for the main product (hydrogen). The results of TEC analysis for hydrogen production from non-renewable and renewable resources are presented and compared with the local energy efficiency of these technologies. The presented results confirm the thesis that local energy efficiency is not a proper tool for evaluation of effectiveness of hydrogen technologies, especially when production of hydrogen from non-renewable and renewable energy is to be compared. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Hydrogen is a suitable renewable energy, which is important for environmental sustainability, renewable energy is considered to be the most environmentally friendly, and cost-effective. However, the efficiency of producing hydrogen via photocatalysis remains low. The efficiency of hydrogen production through photocatalysis can be enhanced by preparing a suitable and efficient photocatalyst. For this purpose, the band gap of metal oxides needs to align to reduce it for the photocatalytic process. To improve the efficiency of hydrogen production the band gap of metal oxides (CdTe, WO3, CuO, SnO2, and MoO3) is aligned to reduce it, for the photocatalytic process in terms of multilayer heterostructure thin films. In this particular study, a physical vapor deposition technique is used to deposit metal oxides (CdTe, WO3, CuO, SnO2, and MoO3) on the ITO substrate. The photo-electrochemical properties of multilayers showed quite better results as compared to individual thin films. The multilayer heterostructure thin film of metal oxides (CdTe, WO3, CuO, SnO2, and MoO3) is carried out through XRD, FTIR, UV, transmittance, SEM, and LSV under dark conditions and light conditions. UV of thin film heterostructure reveals the absorbance of solar spectra and the Tauc plot via UV spectroscopy confirmed the reduction of the band gap of metal oxides. SEM study confirmed the grain size of the thin film and the surface plot of the films for the absorption of solar spectra for the generation of hydrogen. LSV showed better photocurrent response under light conditions as compared to dark conditions. The EIS analysis confirmed the charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface for multilayer heterostructure is much better than that of individual metal oxide thin film. The decrease of the EIS curve confirmed the enhancement of photocurrent. The hydrogen production rate per hour was also measured. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This work presents an optimization procedure for a stand-alone, fully PV-powered alkaline electrolysis system. The approach is based on the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to obtain the best configuration of the PV plant that powers the electrolyzer and its compressor. The best configuration is determined with one of three indicators: cost, efficiency, or wasted energy. The PV plant needs to be oversized 2.63 times with respect to the electrolyzer to obtain minimum cost, while for high efficiency, this number increases by 2%. Additionally, the configuration that minimizes cost, wasted energy or maximizes efficiency does not correspond to the configuration that maximizes the annual PV yield. Optimizing for cost results also leads to the best operation of the electrolyzer at partial loads than optimizing for efficiency or wasted energy. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is seen as a key energy vector in future energy systems due to its ability to be stored in large volumes for long periods, providing energy flexibility and security. Despite the importance of storage in hydrogen's potential role in a zero-carbon energy system, many techno-economic analyses fail to adequately model different storage methods in hydrogen supply chains, often ignoring storage requirements altogether. Therefore, this paper uses a data-driven techno-economic analysis (TEA) tool to examine the effect of storage size and cost on three different 2030 hydrogen supply chain scenarios: wind-based, solar-based, and mixed-source grid electrolysis. For varying storage sizes and specific capital costs, the overall levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), including production, storage, and delivery to a constant demand, varies significantly. The LCOH ranges from €3.90–12.40/kgH2, €5.50–12.75/kgH2, and €2.80–15.65/kgH2 for the wind-based, solar-based, and mixed-source grid scenarios respectively, with lower values for scenarios with low-cost storage. This highlights the critical role of low-cost hydrogen storage in realising the energy flexibility and security electrolytic hydrogen can provide. © 2023 The Authors},

Africa has been identified as a potential key player in the production of green hydrogen not only for itself but also for other countries in Europe. There are however several factors that may either positively or negatively affect the development of green hydrogen on the continent. This study identified some opportunities and barriers to the production of green hydrogen in Africa and used the multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize them. The study identified the opportunity to export to EU market (20.90%), availability of RE resources (34.88%), youthful population (13.95%), Agenda 2063 (9.30%), and ammonia production (20.90%) as some of the opportunities available on the continent. The availability of RE resources was selected as the highest opportunity for the development of hydrogen energy in Africa. High cost of hydrogen (11.78%), dealing with the status-quo (8.82%), corruption in the energy sector (4.52%), land availability issues (7.06%), political instabilities and insecurity in certain parts of the continent (11.76%), lack of the needed skills and education (11.76%), limited supporting infrastructure and financing (15.38%), and lack of the needed regulatory and legal framework (28.95%) were identified as some of the barriers that could affect the development and use of hydrogen in Africa. The study recommends regional and country level policies and cooperation among the various blocs in Africa as an important tool to remove barriers that could hinder the deployment of hydrogen energy on the continent. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The importance of energy storage is increased with the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources (RERs). Green hydrogen is increasingly being employed to address its shortcomings. Furthermore, lowering carbon emissions has accelerated the quest for green alternatives instead of fossil-based fuels. This research focuses on Egypt's capacity to generate green hydrogen using natural renewable resources to serve islanded electrical and hydrogen loads. To obtain the lowest net present cost (NPC), cost of hydrogen (COH), and levelized cost of energy (LCOE), the state-of-the-art prices of the system elements are investigated and optimized using the HOMER professional software. Three situations with solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and hybrid RERs are evaluated in three separate Egyptian cities. A sensitivity analysis is investigated based on the influence of the system's reliability and hydrogen load variance on the cost. The results of the three locations are compared to indicate the best site for green hydrogen production. The results obtained with the wind scenario located on the coast of the Suez Gulf provided the lowest LCOE, ranged from 0.308 $/kWh to 0.353 $/kWh, and the COH ranged from 3.73 $/kg to 4.13 $/kg. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The transition to a low-carbon energy system can be depicted as a “great reconfiguration” from a socio-technical perspective that carries the risk of impact shifts. Electrification with the objective of achieving rapidly deep decarbonisation must be accompanied by effective efficiency and flexibility measures. Hydrogen can be a preferred option in the decarbonisation process where electrification of end-uses is difficult or impractical as well as for long-term storage in energy infrastructure characterised by a large penetration of renewable energy sources. Notwithstanding the current uncertainties regarding costs, environmental impact and the inherent difficulties of increasing rapidly supply capacity, hydrogen can represent a solution to be used in multi-energy systems with combined heat and power (CHP), in particular in urban energy districts. In fact, while achieving carbon savings with natural gas fuelled CHP is not possible when low grid carbon intensity factors are present, it may still be possible to use it to provide flexibility services and to reduce emissions further with switch from natural gas to hydrogen. In this paper, a commercially established urban district energy scheme located in Southampton (United Kingdom) is analysed with the goal of exploring potential variations in its energy demand. The study proposes the use of scalable data-driven methods and probabilistic simulation to generate seasonal energy demand patterns representing the potential short-term and long-term evolution of the energy district. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Electricity-based fuels from renewable energies are regarded as a key instrument for climate protection. These Power-to-X (PtX) products are to replace fossil fuels in sectors where direct use of electricity from renewable energies is not possible. We investigate the production potential of electricity-based fuels from onshore wind energy and ground-mounted photovoltaic energy for all countries outside the European Economic Area along 14 PtX production pathways. These include hydrogen (gaseous and liquid), methane (gaseous and liquid), methanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuels and ammonia each with two different electrolysis technologies. The technical and economic potential assessment is based on data with hourly temporal and high spatial resolution. The analysis considers various criteria, including prevailing weather conditions, sustainability as well as nature conservation concerns and land use. The results show the production quantities and costs of climate-friendly fuel production under strict sustainability criteria and locate them spatially. It is shown that many regions of the world are well suited to produce PtX products. The production quantity outside Europe is up to 120,000 TWhLHV/yr of hydrogen or 87,000 TWhLHV/yr of electricity-based liquid fuels in the long term. We identify 97 countries with potentials, of which 38 countries possess relevant potentials of more than 100 TWhLHV/yr. The largest suitable areas are in the United States, Australia and Argentina. The production costs vary a lot across the different regions. The lowest production costs for PtX generation are in Latin America (Chile, Argentina, and Venezuela) and Mauritania with a lower limit of 42.3 €/MWhLHV to 46.5 €/MWhLHV for gaseous hydrogen and 84 €/MWhLHV to 89.1 €/MWhLHV for Fischer-Tropsch fuels. All best sites are pure wind or combined wind and photovoltaic sites. Moreover, we show import options of these PtX products to Europe considering socioeconomic factors and different transport options.

The substrate, inoculum employed and their concentrations, culture kinds, and pretreatment procedure have all been found to be important in biohydrogen production.

	abstract = {An energy system based on water for creating hydrogen energy might be less globally restricted than one that uses the available fossil fuels today. Therefore, creating an efficient catalyst and electrolyzer system is necessary to effectively convert renewable energy into chemical energy (hydrogen). In this study, a model based on kinetic reaction rate parameters is proposed for estimating energy efficiency and energy conversion for hydrogen generation in a high-voltage alkaline electrolyzer. Three complementary models, including the thermal, electrochemical, and thermodynamic, are conducted to forecast the thermal time constant, overall thermal resistance, operating temperature, electrolyzer voltage, energy consumption, and energy loss. To ensure that they can operate directly with renewable energy sources, the modeling was expanded to incorporate hydrogen production at a voltage level of 6 V. The model's various parameters were computed using non-linear regression presented in Engineering Equation Solver (EES) utilizing experimental data gathered in a high-voltage alkaline test rig. From their precursors and coated on Ti substrates, nanoparticles of Ag, TiO2, and Ag + TiO2 are created as electrocatalysts for the production of hydrogen. In comparison with the bare Ti electrode, the results revealed that energy efficiencies of the Ag, TiO2, and Ag + TiO2 electrodes have increased by 23%, 28%, and 28%, respectively. The largest improvement in hydrogen energy conversion achieved with TiO2 electrodes over Ti electrodes was 84%. Thermodynamic-thermal models that were integrated showed that the coated electrodes decreased the thermal energy loss (TΔS) and useable energy (ΔG) simultaneously during the electrolysis process. The electrochemical model demonstrated a strong fit to the data from those experiments, indicating that the coated nanomaterials are the most important factor in increasing the electrolyzer energy efficiency-based production of hydrogen. The models presented in this research offered a practical method for increasing hydrogen energy production and energy conversion using nanomaterial to build effective electrolyzer devices. The models described in this study are appropriate for the dynamic simulation of renewable energy-hydrogen systems. As a result, these models are easily connected to economic theories that account for both financial and operation expenses. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {As the primary consideration, sizing optimization has great impact on wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen storage integrated energy system (WPHIES) construction. However, few studies on sizing optimization consider the characteristics of renewables coupled with hydrogen storage, or discuss decision-making fuzziness. Therefore, a three-objective mixed integer linear programming model for WPHIES sizing is proposed under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Based on the concept of Energy Trilemma, indexes of the annual comprehensive cost, the annual carbon emission and the external electricity dependence are selected as the optimization objectives. Next, considering that exact numerical evaluation cannot well reflect the uncertainty of decision-making preferences, the intuitionistic fuzzy number is introduced to determine index weights so as to improve the accuracy of decision-making. At last, a case study including comparison, sensitivity and scenario analyses is carried out. Compared with traditional integrated energy system, WPHIES can achieve 15% annual comprehensive cost, 26% annual carbon emission and 84% external electricity dependence of reduction. Furthermore, great priority should be given to photovoltaic so as to promote renewable energy development. This research can not only provide great reference for scholar to explore issues of WPHIES sizing optimization, but also help WPHIES investors or managers efficiently and scientifically arrive at optimal sizing schemes. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

For that purpose, we apply an integrated energy system model which includes all demand sectors of the German energy system and optimizes the transformation pathway from today's energy system to a future cost-optimal energy system. We show that 412 TWh of hydrogen are needed in the year 2045, mostly in the industry and transport sector. Particularly, the use of about 267 TWh of hydrogen in industry is essential as there are no cost-effective alternatives for the required emission reduction in the chemical industry or in steel production. Furthermore, we illustrate that the German hydrogen supply in the year 2045 requires both an expansion of domestic electrolyzer capacity to 71 GWH2 and hydrogen imports from other European countries and Northern Africa of about 196 TWh. Moreover, flexible operation of electrolyzers is cost-optimal and crucial for balancing the intermittent nature of volatile renewable energy sources. Additionally, a conducted sensitivity analysis shows that full domestic hydrogen supply in Germany is possible but requires an electrolyzer capacity of 111 GWH2. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for integrating renewable energy sources (RES) and power-to-gas (P2G) technologies to optimize energy utilization efficiency as RES capacity increases. The method introduces the potential RES penetration index (PRPI) to select the appropriate capacity of P2G facilities for improved RES acceptance rates. In order to establish input constraints for RES and P2G facilities, this study determines the saturation point of RES (R-SP) and the saturation point of P2G (PG-SP). Additionally, the paper introduces the marginal capacity rate of RES to P2G (MCRG) as a useful tool for evaluating the adequacy of planned facilities. This paper's index is limited to PV as a renewable energy source. By incorporating PRPI into the input plan of P2G facilities, the proposed method improves PV's acceptance rate, contributes to facilities' economic planning, and streamlines optimization complexity. Previous studies have demonstrated the potential for P2G technology to optimize the integration of PV into the grid. However, the proposed method considers the PV's acceptance rate and provides system planners with necessary information on RES and P2G facility capacity.

	abstract = {Due to the unpredictability of renewable energy sources (RESs) in Microgrids (MG), the Load Frequency Control (LFC) mechanism is crucial for frequency management of these systems. Frequency control in MGs can be made more cost-effective with the help of demand-side management by temporarily boosting or decreasing power usage, in addition to Automatic Generation Control (AGC) techniques. Hydrogen can provide considerable benefits to MGs since it can be used in two ways: as a fuel cell for electricity generation or as an electrolyzer for power consumption, satisfying the needs of AGC and demand response (DR) simultaneously utilizing Hydrogen Energy Storage (HES) system. This research proposes an MG structure that integrates appropriate energy storage technologies, is able to provide both energy and waste management, and enables use of a variety of RES (including solar, wind, wastewater, agricultural, and residential wastes). With the newly announced Improved-Salp Swarm Algorithm (ISSA), this research aims to design a novel double-input interval type-2 fuzzy fractional order proportional-integral-derivative PI + TID (DIT2-FOPI + TID) cascade controller for LFC of multi-area MGs considering DR with a broad range of Distributed energy resources (DER). In all case studies, the proposed controller demonstrates outstanding effectiveness within the setting of LFC of MGs and, especially by employing DRM approaches, boosts frequency response performance by up to 65%. The results indicate that the dynamic frequency response of the MG is significantly enhanced by the addition of DRM capability with the HES system. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Renewable methanol has potential to be a key vector for attaining net zero emissions by providing a pathway to carbon neutrality for the value chains of carbon intensive industries with hard to abate emissions. To deliver an accurate assessment of feasibility, it is critical to understand the integrated operation and economies of the connected generation and conversion technologies that make up Power-to-Methanol (PtM) pathways. Given the highly variable nature of renewable energy (RE) and green hydrogen generation, it is also important to consider the need for feedstock and energy buffers to achieve reliable operation. Herein, we developed a globally applicable open-source cost framework consisting of a farm-to-gate model of Power-to-Methanol (PtM) populated with performance and cost functions from process simulation, recent literature, and industry consultation. This open-source tool was developed to evaluate PtM projects at various scales and locations, utilizing different recycled carbon feedstock sources, with a range of renewable power generation and electrolyser configurations, as well as balancing technologies including intermediate feedstock and power storage options. A key feature of the tool is the ability to analyse and optimize the incorporation of these balancing technologies. By using present cost estimates and defining design constraints to maintain operational viability, we apply this framework to map out the economies of PtM for potentially suitable Australian and international locations as case studies. The study estimates indicative levelized cost of methanol (LCMeOH) of 1360 A$/tMeOH and 1710 A$/tMeOH corresponding to PtM including CO2 sourced from industrial flue gas (IFG) and direct air capture (DAC) respectively. While the case studies analysed in this work consist mainly of Australian locations, the open-source tool is applicable for other global locations as demonstrated by the cases evaluated for PtM in Chile and Germany. The tool presented here aims to serve as a customisable framework to support the assessment, optimization, and deployment of commercial scale e-methanol projects. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The distributed integration of renewable energy sources plays a central role in the decarbonization of economies. In this regard, energy communities arise as a promising entity to coordinate groups of proactive consumers (prosumers) and incentivize investment on clean technologies. However, the uncertain nature of renewable energy generation, residential loads, and trading tariffs pose important challenges, both at the operational and economic levels. We study how this management can be directly undertaken by an arbitrageur that, making use of an adequate price-based demand response (real-time pricing) system, serves as an intermediary with the central electricity market to coordinate different types of prosumers under risk aversion. In particular, we consider a sequential futures and spot market where the aggregated shortage or excess of energy within the community can be traded. We aim to study the impact of new hydrogen production and storage technologies on community operation and risk management. These interactions are modeled as a game theoretical setting in the form of a stochastic two-stage bilevel optimization problem, which is later reformulated without approximation as a single-level mixed-integer linear problem (MILP). An extensive set of numerical experiments based on real data is performed to study the operation of the energy community under different technical and economical conditions. Results indicate that the optimal involvement in futures and spot markets is highly conditioned by the community's risk aversion and self-sufficiency levels. Moreover, the external hydrogen market has a direct effect on the community's internal price-tariff system, and depending on the market conditions, may worsen the utility of individual prosumers. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is central to meeting the challenge of climate change. The lack of infrastructure to produce, store, and deliver hydrogen is a significant obstacle to transitioning toward a hydrogen economy. For two decades, researchers have been interested in modeling the hydrogen supply chain network to provide managerial insights for decision-makers. We contribute to this research domain by introducing the life cycle optimization (LCO) modeling framework into the hydrogen supply chain network design (HSCND). Specifically, the life cycle costing (LCC) methodology and the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach are integrated through a bi-objective optimization. The two objectives are levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) and global warming potential (GWP) intensity. The problem is solved by implementing an ε-constraint method. The developed LCO framework is applied to a case study in Franche-Comté, France. Results obtained suggest that the introduction of LCC has a major impact on capital costs. The LCA, especially the life cycle inventory (LCI) approach, enables the LCO model to estimate emissions reasonably. The Pareto front obtained by solving the bi-objective model provides a holistic view of turning points. It is concluded that the modeling framework proposed in the paper can provide decision-makers with (i) comprehensive reflection of hydrogen supply network costs; (ii) a detailed description of hydrogen supply chain network-related emissions; and (iii) the quantification and visualization of the trade-off between costs and emissions. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A clean and carbon-free energy market can be more sustainable and safer that can be approaches by investing on hydrogen energy. Further, a renewable energy-driven energy production cycle coupled with an energy storage option is of major significance. In the present article, a hybrid process based on geothermal and solar energies is conceptually designed and simulated. The process is comprised of a solar-organic Rankine cycle (ORC) unit, a geothermal cycle, an electrolysis unit (based on alkaline electrolyzer stack, AES), and a nanomaterial-based unit (i.e., alkaline fuel cell stack, AFC) to store hydrogen. Combining nickel nanoparticles thermally enclosed in multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with a composite thermoset anion-exchange membrane enables alkaline water splitting. When the grid demands are less than generated electricity rate, additional electricity is fed into an AES to generate hydrogen fuel. Further, when the grid demands are more than generated electricity rate, stored hydrogen and oxygen are fed into an AFC to back convert the chemical energy in the fuel into electrical energy. The thermodynamic and thermo-economic evaluations of the considered hybrid process are comprehensively presented. Furthermore, multi-objective optimization of the introduced process has been developed in accordance with the genetic optimization technique to maximize the rate of electricity and minimize the cost rate. Additionally, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) -based optimization technique is established and discussed. The outcomes indicated that under the LSTM-based genetic optimization technique the output electricity and electricity and hydrogen costs of the considered hybrid process can be improved by 34.55% and reduced by 40.3% and 26.8%, respectively. It was also found that the estimations obtained from the LSTM technique are very reliable, and can be relied on with acceptable accuracy. The estimation based on LSTM has an accuracy level of more than 98.1%. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen has been proposed as energy vector because it can be produced from renewable energy sources and its use produces no carbon dioxide. Moreover, many industrial processes (e.g., steel industry, ammonia, and fertilizer industry, etc.) are also adopting renewable-produced hydrogen as raw material, replacing traditional fossil sources. In this context, the storage and transportation of hydrogen using liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) is interesting to deal with the discontinuous production of renewable energies. The work addressed the study of the hydrogenation process for three compounds, 3,5-dibenzyl toluene, 2-methyl indole and N-ethylcarbazole, on Ni and Ru-based catalysts. The reactor consisted of a three-phase slurry stirred tank reactor, which has been scale-up together with the rest of the process equipment units using Aspen Hysys simulation software. The hydrogen storage cost has been determined applying an economic evaluation to the overall process. The most important costs of the process are the reactor cost and the cost of raw materials (the liquid organic hydrogen carrier). The main design variables, plant capacity, reactor temperature and pressure, were optimized to reduce the storage cost. The liquid organic hydrogen carrier with the minimum storage cost at the optimum operating conditions is 3,5-dibenzyl toluene with a reactor configuration of two parallel tanks. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This the second of a two-part study investigating the feasibility of producing export quantities (770 t/d) of blue hydrogen meeting international emissions standards, by gasification of Victorian lignite plus carbon capture and storage (CCS). Part 1 focussed on the resources, energy requirements, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of gaseous and liquefied hydrogen, while Part 2 focusses on the production of ammonia as an alternative hydrogen carrier for export. In this study, an Aspen Plus simulation of a conventional 1500 t d−1 iron-based catalyst Haber-Bosch ammonia synthesis process is developed and incorporated into the earlier lignite-to-hydrogen process model. Development of the simulation involves (i) estimation of the instantaneous rate kinetics, (ii) calibration against test data for a reactor of known dimensions, (iii) scaling up the bed dimensions to achieve a target production capacity, (iv) selecting an appropriate feed gas composition to optimise performance, (v) adjusting purge gas flowrates to achieve stable operation, and (v) incorporation into the previous lignite-to-hydrogen simulation. This study finds that 178.2 t h−1 liquid ammonia and all electricity required to support the process can be produced from 1050 t h−1 Victorian lignite. Surprisingly, the simulation results show that the electrical power requirement for ammonia synthesis (176.4 MW) is essentially the same as that needed for liquefaction of an equivalent output of hydrogen (175.5 MW). On this basis both options are equally attractive, although ammonia synthesis is at a higher level of technological maturity than large-scale hydrogen liquefaction. This is the first study to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of ammonia production from lignite, accounting for the full production chain from lignite mining to CO2 sequestration. It is found that ammonia can be produced from Victorian lignite with very low CO2 emission intensity (0.49 kgCO2-e kgNH3−1) equivalent to that of next-generation natural gas reforming with CCS processes. If required, the emission intensity can be reduced to 0.05kgCO2-e kgNH3−1 with a post-combustion CO2 capture system, and then made carbon neutral by co-gasification with ≤1.4% biomass. For comparison, this study also examines the implications of producing the same quantity of green ammonia using renewable energy alone. It is estimated that production of 178.2 t h−1 green ammonia would require 1946 MW renewable energy and associated transmission infrastructure. In Victoria, this could be supplied by a wind farm with a 5.4 GW rated capacity, occupying an area of over 72,000 ha. This is highly unlikely to be a viable option. This analysis indicates that clean hydrogen in the form of ammonia, produced in Victoria by lignite gasification with CCS, can be consistent with global emissions reductions targets over the next few decades. The unique combination of low-cost lignite and high-quality CO2 storage geology means that Victoria is well placed to become a significant exporter of low-emissions ammonia to the world market. Further research is recommended on recovery of energy from the low grade waste heat streams and opportunities for additional electricity generation using the organic Rankine cycle. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The current study explores the multifaceted potential of green hydrogen as a key player in creating a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy landscape for electricity production under five different renewable-based configurations. This study aims to provide a complete assessment (energy, exergy, economic, and enviroeconomic) of all-day clean electricity generation systems containing integrated green hydrogen systems, comprising Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers and fuel cells and using several different clean power sources, such as Photovoltaic (PV) and Photovoltaic/Thermal (PVT) solar collectors and Wind Turbines (WT).

A MATLAB/Simulink code has been built to simulate these systems under the climatic conditions of two solar and wind-dominant locations in Egypt. The results revealed that the required amount of electricity to produce hydrogen ranges from 56.17 kWh/kgH2 to 56.87 kWh/kgH2. The total energy and exergy efficiencies are up to 35% and 17%, respectively. Moreover, the minimum values of LCOE, LCOH, and LCOEFC are 0.028 $/kWh, 2.84 $/kg, and 0.253 $/kWh.

	abstract = {Green steel, produced using renewable energy and hydrogen, presents a promising avenue to decarbonize steel manufacturing and expand the hydrogen industry. Australia, endowed with abundant renewable resources and iron ore deposits, is ideally placed to support this global effort. This paper's two-step analytical approach offers the first comprehensive assessment of Australia's potential to develop green steel as a value-added export commodity. The Economic Fairways modelling reveals a strong alignment between prospective hydrogen hubs and current and future iron ore operations, enabling shared infrastructure development and first-mover advantages. By employing a site-based system optimization that integrates both wind and solar power sources, the cost of producing green steel could decrease significantly to around AU$900 per tonne by 2030 and AU$750 per tonne by 2050. Moreover, replacing 1% of global steel production would require 35 GW of well-optimized wind and solar photovoltaics, 11 GW of hydrogen electrolysers, and 1000 square kilometres of land. Sensitivity analysis further indicates that iron ore prices would exert a long-term influence on green steel prices. Overall, this study highlights the opportunities and challenges facing the Australian iron ore industry in contributing to the decarbonization of the global steel sector, underscoring the crucial role of government support in driving the growth and development of the green steel industry. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The production of green hydrogen-based chemicals using renewable energy is essential for the decarbonization of several sectors that are difficult to address through electrification. Various electrolysis technologies are often considered for sustainable green hydrogen production. They are therefore in a phase of dynamic development. Currently, hydrogen production costs are calculated on the basis of investment costs and lifetimes of the most recent components and future production costs are calculated using development targets. The impact of ongoing developments during the project lifetime is neglected. However, these ongoing developments will have an impact on the estimation of the levelized cost of hydrogen, which is expected to be non-neglectable. This paper proposes a novel methodology that incorporates the impact of evolving electrolysis technologies on the levelized cost of hydrogen. By integrating cost and lifetime development functions, the presented approach allows for precise hydrogen cost estimations tailored to individual stack replacements, adapting to varying annual operating times. Moreover, project-specific investment costs can be derived for a more accurate calculation of the hydrogen production costs. With this method, an average capital cost reduction of more than 11% is achieved for all investigated technologies compared to a cost estimation neglecting ongoing technology developments. The methodology presented provides a comprehensive understanding of ongoing technology developments that affect the economics of hydrogen production. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper presents a study that focuses on alleviating the impacts of grid outages in Ethiopia. To deal with grid outages, most industrial customers utilize backup diesel generators (DG) which are environmentally unfriendly and economically not viable. Grid-integration of hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) might be a possible solution to enhance grid reliability and reduce environmental and economic impacts of utilizing DG. In this study, an optimization of grid integrated HRES is carried out for different dispatch and control strategies. The optimal power supply option is determined by performing comparative analysis of the different configurations of grid integrated HRES. The result of the study shows that grid integrated HRES consisting of photovoltaic and wind turbine as renewable energy sources, and battery and hydrogen as hybrid energy storage systems is found to be the optimal system to supply the load demand. From the hydrogen produced on-site, the FC generator and FCEVs consume 143 620 kg/yr of hydrogen which is equivalent to 394 955 kg/yr gasoline fuel consumption. This corresponds to saving 1 184 865 kg/yr of CO2 emissions and 605 703 $/yr revenue. Besides, this system yields 547 035.4 $/yr revenue by injecting excess electricity to the grid. The study clearly shows the economic and environmental viability of this new technology for implementation. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Direct air capture (DAC) is widely investigated to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from decentralised sources. As an alternative to geological storage, CO2 from DAC can be reacted with hydrogen (H2) from water electrolysis driven by renewable energy to produce synthetic methane (CH4), increasing the penetration of renewable energies and leading to a circular carbon economy. This study presents a techno-economic assessment of an integrated system for DAC based on calcium looping and subsequent methanation of CO2. Photovoltaics (PV) is considered as renewable energy source. For the DAC plant, heat exchangers represent the most expensive component, followed by blowers/compressors, reactors and gas heaters. The levelized cost of CO2 removal for DAC ranges within 693–1587 € tCO2−1 according to the parameters considered. For a methanation plant built in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates), the electrolyzer represents the most expensive component, followed by PV field, H2 storage tank, and reactors. Altogether, the levelized cost of methane (LCOM) ranges within 4.9–8.2 € kgCH4−1 for integration with the DAC plant investigated. It reduces to 3.1–3.9 € kgCH4−1 for integration with point source carbon capture. A comparison between Abu Dhabi and Benevento (Italy) reveals that cities with an uneven distribution of solar energy throughout the year may require a large investment cost for the H2 storage tank, that makes the LCOM increase. In conclusion, LCOM values provided in this study exceeds the current price of methane, suggesting that further improvements or economic incentives are required to increase the competitiveness of this power-to-gas technology. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {To achieve carbon neutrality in the industrial sector, variable low-carbon and low-cost electricity sources, together with a variety of storage technologies, maybe the only viable path. Here, we investigate the diverse scenarios for manufacturing facilities (MF) under different emission reduction targets to determine the least-cost decarbonization pathway. This study developed a multi-energy model to assess emission reduction versus cost ratio and gave a technology roadmap for MF, i.e., cost-effectiveness of each technology at a given decarbonization level. We optimized the dispatch of each scenario with the least cost objective and step-wise reduced the emissions of selected exemplar European MF from current levels until the solution came out as infeasible due to the lifecycle emissions of considered technologies. Results showed that electrical boiler became key technology from 10% emission reduction target (ERT), while battery storage is cost-effective for medium ERT and H2 facility remains a critical part of achieving deep decarbonization targets (>80%). This analysis reveals a basic understanding of a given technology's economic viability to target a certain decarbonization goal and would help guide MF that are more inclined to invest in having their green energy distributed system. Sensitivity analysis of key parameter values (i.e., grid electricity/gas prices, technology costs) reveals that the H2 facility will play a critical role in deep decarbonization and high gas prices made the expensive heat pumps cost-effective in all scenarios. Furthermore, the future costs of electrolyzer, fuel cell, heat pump, and battery storage will decide the technological transformation speed for the industrial sector. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The present work introduces a new integrated system for higher penetration of renewable energy in local energy grids, flattening the peak load, dealing with worldwide energy demands, and slowing climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The idea involves solar and biomass combination through high-temperature parabolic solar collectors and a gasifier unit for clean heating production with minimal emission and the highest reliability. The system also has Rankine and Organic Rankine cycles for efficient power generation. Additionally, the surplus heat is exploited via a multi-stage flash desalination unit and absorption chiller for potable water and cooling generation with minimal cost thanks to the passive energy improvement method. In addition, proton exchange membrane electrolyzers are added for green hydrogen production from the surplus power. An in-depth thermodynamic, exergo-economic, and environmental assessment is conducted to evaluate the proposed renewable combination from all aspects using an engineering equation solver. Then, a multi-objective optimization method is implemented to find the most favorable operating condition in the MATLAB program. According to the results, chemical reactions, friction, and large temperature variations between the steam entering and leaving the gasifier unit are the main drivers of the energy system's exergy destruction. This is especially true in the gasifier unit. The gas turbine inlet temperature is vital for improving power generation and minimizing costs, according to the scatter distribution analysis of key design parameters. The results further show that energy and exergy efficiencies at the design condition are 39.5% and 28.1%. According to the results, the optimization improves the exergy efficiency and power production by 2.5% and 9000 kW, respectively.

	abstract = {As a secondary energy source, hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is a promising way to sustainably use electricity generated from primary renewable resources. Thereby, hydrogen is not only a highly relevant feedstock for producing chemical products, such as fertilizers and platform chemicals, but also a valuable energy carrier that can be readily transported and stored. This study explores how transporting renewable hydrogen via pipeline from regions with high renewable energy potential to large consumer centers can help overcome current challenges in ensuring a climate-friendly renewable energy supply. To this end, this work assesses the environmental impacts of cross-border hydrogen supply chains relative to the attained operating hours of local hydrogen production and the required hydrogen transport distance via pipeline. Environmental hotspots along the hydrogen supply chain and the main parameters affecting the overall environmental impact were identified. Remarkably, an environmental trade-off emerges: the most suitable local conditions for producing renewable hydrogen need to be balanced against the distance of hydrogen transport to consumers. Nonetheless, the relevance of the transport distance decreases with an increasing share of renewable energies in the electricity mix for operating the compressor stations of the pipeline network. Considering the ongoing transition towards renewable power generation technologies, our results indicate that long-distance hydrogen transport via pipeline is environmentally justified provided that the share of renewable energies used to operate the compressor stations increases. © 2023},

	abstract = {As our world continues to rapidly industrialize and our population grows at an unprecedented rate, the energy demands have become one of the primary drivers for economic growth. However, the availability of traditional fossil fuels is limited and their use leads to serious environmental problems. Recently, in the last few decades, many developments have been made in the area of energy efficiency driven by non-conventional energy sources. So, inclination towards renewables such as solar (PV) energy, wind power, hydro energy, bio-fuels, bio/green-hydrogen, etc., seems to be a feasible alternative in the coming future. Technology alternatives dealing with fuel cells appears to be a promising approach to fulfil the ever-exceeding energy requirements. The purpose of the present research is to extract information about the working principle and applications of renewable energy technologies such as photo-electrolysis, photovoltaic power, wind power, electrolyzer for hydrogen generation, fuel cells for power generation and also to gain knowledge for the future research and improvements for the renewable technology systems. All the experiments are conducted with the help of Heliocentric, the kit for green and clean energy trainer technology. Here the energy efficiency for the system is found to be ∼86% with a hydrogen volume of 30 cm3 and a time of 174 s (∼3 min). Similarly, for a system with 25 cm3 of hydrogen volume and a time of 110 s, the efficiency calculated is around ∼36%. The research work outcomes are anticipated to help in the clear understanding of renewable energy technologies and their integration to produce sustainable, green and clean energy. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

However, the utilization of costly electrode materials and cell components has resulted in expensive hydrogen production costs and limited its commercial applications.

In this study, a COMSOL Multiphysics model was developed for a 25 cm2 single cell PEM water electrolyser with parallel flow field configurations to investigate its performance including operating principles, mechanisms, and ion transport properties. Subsequently, the model was validated with in-house experimental data at different operating conditions. Impressively, it effectively predicted the current-voltage polarization curves, demonstrating strong correlation with the experimental data. For a more rigorous comparison between experimental and numerical simulation, the normalized root mean square deviation was calculated for current-voltage polarization curves at various temperatures, ranging from 30 °C to 80 °C. The deviation was observed to be around 1.1% across all the temperatures, an acceptably low error value. In addition, the model was used to analyze the reactant flow and thermal distributions.

	abstract = {Considering the abundance of renewable energy potential in Turkey, green hydrogen derived from renewable sources holds great promise as a fuel. This paper presents a model for obtaining green hydrogen from medium-temperature geothermal sources. In this model, the Zilan location in the Van province of Turkey was identified as a suitable site for electricity and hydrogen production from low or medium-temperature geothermal sources due to its significant geothermal and water resource potential. In this regard, the installed capacity of the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) geothermal power plant is determined by using Monte Carlo Simulation based on the characteristics of the geothermal well at this location, and subsequently, the hydrogen production performance has been evaluated by analyzing the water of Lake Van. According to the analysis results, Lake Van was found to be efficient for hydrogen production. Hydrogen production from Lake Van water was subsequently simulated using the electrolysis method with this ORC geothermal power plant. According to the findings of this model, the hourly hydrogen production potential at this location using a 1.4 MW ORC plant, based on 2022 data, was estimated to be 18.6 kg, which is projected to increase to 28 kg based on 2050 estimated data. In addition, the techno-economic analysis of this compact green hydrogen production process was conducted in the study. The production cost of 1 kg of hydrogen was calculated to be €4.91 in 2022, while it is expected to be €1.21 in 2050.

	abstract = {The necessity of energy solutions that are economically viable, ecologically sustainable and environmentally friendly has become fundamental to economic and societal advancement of nations. In this context, renewable energy sources emerge as the most vital component. Furthermore, hydrogen generation systems based on renewable energies are increasingly recognized as the most crucial strategies to mitigate global warming. In the present study, a comparative analysis is conducted from an exergy-economic perspective to find the most efficient configuration among three different systems for renewable-based power to hydrogen production. These renewable sources are wind turbine, salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP), and ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). SGSP and OTEC are coupled with a hydrogen production unit by a trilateral cycle (TLC) to improve the temperature match of the heating process. The heat waste energy within these systems is recovered by a thermoelectric generator (TEG), and a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEME) is used for hydrogen production. Under base case input conditions, the net power input of PEME is estimated to be approximately 327.8 kW across all configurations. Additionally, the 3E (energy, exergy, and exergy-economic) performance of the three systems is evaluated by a parametric study and design optimization. The results of the best performance analysis reveal that the best exergy efficiency is achievable with the wind-based system in the range of 5.8–10.47% and for average wind speed of 8–12 m/s. Correspondingly, the most favorable total cost rate is attributed to the wind-based system at a wind speed of 8 m/s, equating to 66.08 USD/h. Subsequently, the unit cost of hydrogen for the SGSP-based system is estimated to be the most economical, ranging from 42.78 to 44.31 USD/GJ. © 2024 The Author(s)},

This paper conducts a techno-economic analysis on six hydrogen supply routes for hydrogen refueling stations, including gas-hydrogen tube-trailer, gas-hydrogen pipeline, liquid-hydrogen truck, natural gas pipeline, MeOH truck, and NH3 truck. Furthermore, the impacts of three critical factors are examined, including electrolyzer selection, transportation distance, and electricity price. The results indicate that, with a transport distance of 2000 km, the natural gas pipeline route offers the lowest cost, while the gas-hydrogen tube-trailer route is not economically feasible. The gas-hydrogen pipeline route shows outstanding cost competitiveness between 200 and 2000 km, while it is greatly influenced by the utilization rate. The liquid-hydrogen truck route demonstrates great potential with the electricity price decreasing.

	abstract = {Concerns about energy security, energy prices and climate change led scientific research towards sustainable solutions to fossil fuel as renewable energy sources coupled to hydrogen as energy vector and carbon capture and conversion technologies. Among the technologies investigated in the last decades, biomass gasification acquired great interest owing to the possibility to obtain low cost and CO2 negative emission hydrogen production from a large variety of everywhere available organic wastes. Upstream and downstream treatment were then studied in order to maximize hydrogen yield, reduce the content of organic and inorganic contaminants under the admissible levels for the technologies which are coupled with, capture, and convert carbon dioxide. However, studies which analyse a whole process made of all those technologies is still missing. In order to fill this lack, the present paper investigated the coexistence of Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC), Sorption Enhance Gasification (SEG), Hot Gas Cleaning (HGC), and CO2 conversion by Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma reactor for H2 production from biomass waste by means of Aspen Plus software. The proposed model aimed to identify and optimise the performance of the plant by varying operating parameters (such as temperature, CaO/biomass ratio, separation efficiency, etc.). The carbon footprint of the global plant is 2.3 kg CO2/kg H2, lower than the latest limit value imposed by the European Commission to consider hydrogen as “clean”, that was set to 3 kg CO2/kg H2. The hydrogen yield referred to the whole plant is 250 gH2/kgBIOMASS. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {High cost and depletion of fossil fuels obligate the researchers to find energy sources that are not only renewable but can also replace the conventional sources. In this work, various catalysts namely, CdS, Cu@CdS, Ni@CdS and Cu/Ni@CdS were synthesized by the hydrothermal technique. To enhance the activity and stability, Cu/Ni cocatalysts were in-situ deposited over CdS surfaces by chemical reduction method. As-prepared catalysts were employed for photoreaction to generate hydrogen from water-splitting. The optical characteristics of catalysts were determined by UV-VIS/DRS and PL techniques. Morphology of catalysts was evaluated by XRD, Raman, SEM and AFM analysis. The surface properties and elemental compositions were justified via EDX and XPS analysis. Comparative H2 generation activities were monitored at GC-TCD (Shimadzu-2010). Results depict that an optimized ratio of cocatalysts (i.e. 2% Cu and 1% Ni) over the CdS exhibits higher H2 evolution activities (i.e. 14.16 mmol g−1 h−1 with 72% quantum efficiencies). Higher activities were attributed to synergism between Cu and Ni cocatalysts. The Cu cocatalysts supplement the electron populations over the CdS surfaces by surface plasmon resonance, whereas Ni cocatalysts suppress the back reaction due to the formation of Schottky junctions. The photocatalytic H2 productions were optimized for various factors such as, pH, temperature, photocatalyst dosage and light intensity. On the basis of results, it could be concluded that this research will add new promises for renewable energy applications. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In the context of renewable energy systems, microgrids (MG) are a solution to enhance the reliability of power systems. In the last few years, there has been a growing use of energy storage systems (ESSs), such as hydrogen and battery storage systems, because of their environmentally-friendly nature as power converter devices. However, their short lifespan represents a major challenge to their commercialization on a large scale. To address this issue, the control strategy proposed in this paper includes cost functions that consider the degradation of both hydrogen devices and batteries. Moreover, the proposed controller uses scenarios to reflect the stochastic nature of renewable energy resources (RESs) and load demand. The objective of this paper is to integrate a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) strategy for an economical/environmental MG coupled with hydrogen and battery ESSs, which interacts with the main grid and external consumers. The system's participation in the electricity market is also managed. Numerical analyses are conducted using RESs profiles, and spot prices of solar panels and wind farms in Abu Dhabi, UAE, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller in the presence of uncertainties. Based on the results, the developed control has been proven to effectively manage the integrated system by meeting overall constraints and energy demands, while also reducing the operational cost of hydrogen devices and extending battery lifetime. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: The need for clean and renewable energy resources is increasing day by day. One of the most important of these resources is hydrogen, known as green energy. The most environmentally friendly method among hydrogen production processes is the electrolysis, in which pure hydrogen is obtained without any separation and purification processes. Carbon emissions is zero during production. The disadvantage of this method is that the production costs are high. For this reason, this study is aimed at improving a cathode material, which play a major role in the efficiency of electrolyzers. Method: Electrochemically Ni, hydrothermally CoW and CoIr nanoparticles modified graphite electrodes are prepared as hydrogen evolution catalysts. The hydrothermally synthesized nanoparticles are impregnated on Ni-deposited graphite. The hydrogen evolution reaction activity of the prepared electrodes was investigated by electrochemical techniques. The cyclic voltammetry, linear sweep voltammetry, potentiodynamic polarization, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques performed the electrochemical analyzes. The surface morphology and chemical composition of the synthesized nanoparticles were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction techniques. Significant Findings: The catalytic efficiency is near for C/NiCoIr, and C/NiCoW electrodes, which has hydrogen volume of 108 and 105 mL cm−2 h−1 by electrolysis of water. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Here we compare the water demands and operating costs for a solar-driven electrolyser facility (powered by solar PV) operating on desalinated seawater produced using reverse osmosis or low-temperature multi-effect distillation. The waste heat was managed via passive cooling, evaporative cooling or through thermal recovery. It was found that the costs for low-temperature multi-effect distillation were up to 85% lower than reverse osmosis and generated 50–270L/ kgH2 of surplus water for ancillary benefit.

	abstract = {Widely available and low-cost solar photovoltaics and wind power can enable production of renewable electricity-based hydrogen at many locations throughout the world. Hydrogen is expected to emerge as an important energy carrier constituting some of the final energy demand; however, its most important role will be as feedstock for further processing to e-fuels, e-chemicals, and e-steel. Apart from meeting their own hydrogen demand, countries may have opportunities to export hydrogen to countries with area limitations or higher production costs. This paper assesses the feasibility of e-hydrogen imports to Germany and Finland from two case regions with a high availability of low-cost renewable electricity, Chile and Morocco, in comparison to domestic supply. Special attention is paid to the transport infrastructure, which has a crucial impact on the economic viability of imports via two routes, shipping and pipelines. This study has found that despite lower e-hydrogen production costs in Morocco and Chile compared to Germany and Finland, additional transportation costs make imports of e-hydrogen economically unattractive. In early 2020s, imported fuel costs are 39–79% and 34–100% higher than e-hydrogen produced in Germany and Finland, respectively. In 2050, imported e-hydrogen is projected to be 39–70% more expensive than locally produced e-hydrogen in Germany and 43–54% in the case of Finland. e-Hydrogen may become a fuel that is mostly produced domestically and may be feasible for imports only in specific locations. Local e-hydrogen production may also lower dependence on imports, enhance energy security, and add jobs. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This study assesses the techno-economic feasibility of green hydrogen in the unexploited northwest landlocked regions of Oman, capitalizing on unused renewable resources to facilitate a sustainable energy transition. In this study, a renewable energy system and green hydrogen production facility are sized to meet a fixed demand of hydrogen (100 metric tons per day) across five potential areas. Technical and economic metrics are then evaluated for various renewable energy combinations. The results reveal the lowest levelized cost of hydrogen in a standalone solar energy scenario, ranging from $8.34 to $16.73 per kilogram of hydrogen. Additionally, the levelized cost is projected and benchmarked against internationally reported values by IEA and IRENA, offering insights into the system's economics and guiding advancements in technology and policy. Further, the produced green hydrogen is anticipated to play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the nearby petroleum fields, small and medium enterprises, and domestic infrastructure.

	abstract = {With the ever-increasing penetration rate of distributed renewable energy in the smart grid, the role of consumers is shifted to prosumers, and shared energy storage can be a potential measure to improve the operating income of prosumers. Nevertheless, the energy cooperation strategies of high-altitude prosumers (HAPs) are rarely studied. This study proposes an energy cooperation framework for HAPs, aiming to improve the economic flexibility of HAP operations and promote the cooperation framework. Firstly, a combined oxygen supply model for HAPs is proposed to satisfy the electricity and oxygen supply demand in high-altitude areas. Secondly, a composite energy storage provider (CESP) is introduced to provide electricity‑oxygen‑hydrogen composite energy storage sharing services and to establish an energy cooperation framework between HAPs and CESPs. Moreover, an asymmetric profit distribution model with the contributions of multiple energy sharing is proposed, and a two-stage profit distribution is carried out for CESPs and HAPs. Finally, the multi-scenario analysis and comparison are conducted to assess the overall benefits of the framework. From the research results, the proposed framework outperforms the independent HAPs, and the economic benefits, primary energy saving rate, system independence, and self-sufficiency rate have increased by 1609.91 CNY, 15.00%, 10.75%, and 15.31%, respectively. This study provides a feasible framework for energy cooperation among HAPs, and the framework's effectiveness is well-validated. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The cogeneration model is built to meet the load demand of independent houses in remote areas and avoids excessive consumption of traditional energy and environmental pollution. Here, the exergoenvironmental analysis adopts the Eco-indicator-99 method and the all life cycle assessment method is used to calculate the environmental impact of each component. Two comparative studies are conducted to the 4E analyses. The first one compares the comprehensive performance of the battery storage and hydrogen production for energy storage. The results indicate that the cogeneration system using both batteries and hydrogen production for energy storage has the best overall performance. According the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyses, its environmental impact is 23.6% lower than the cogeneration system using batteries alone and the PV/T can be fully utilized. In addition, the total cost rate is 6.2% lower than the cogeneration system using hydrogen production alone. The second case investigates the effect of adding the evacuated tube solar collectors between the PV/T and ORC on the cogeneration system. The analysis results demonstrate that the evacuated tube solar collectors can increase the heat source temperature of the ORC to increase the power generation of the ORC by 37.14%; however, the total cost rate of the cogeneration system increases by 3.7% and the environmental impact rate increases by 19.8%. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Second, based on it, a two-stage integrated planning model is established to minimize the total investment and operation cost. The construction of hydrogen refueling stations, electrolysis-based hydrogen generation stations and hydrogen pipelines are coordinated with their operating constraints, constituting the green hydrogen supply chain, in which hydrogen storage is also an important part for consideration to address variable renewable power. Then, the proposed model is reformulated as a mixed integer linear programing (MILP) problem solved efficiently. Finally, the case studies are carried out on an urban area in Xi'an China to verify the validity and correctness of the proposed method. The results show that the integrated planning can realize synergy benefits. The influence of electricity prices and k values is also discussed. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Renewable energy resources have gotten considerable attention in recent years owing to significant advancements in power electronics technologies, decreased cost of utilizing renewable resources, and increasing concerns about environmental pollutants, particularly in stand-alone applications. Utilizing entirely renewable resources to meet demand has numerous advantages, including lower energy prices, energy price stability, local accessibility, etc. The capability to apply a modified combination of the gray wolf optimization algorithm and the sine–cosine algorithm is evaluated to minimize the levelized cost of energy and the total annualized net present cost (comprising investment, replacement, decommissioning, and operation & maintenance costs) of the proposed system while complying with system constraints and demand requirements. The optimal power planning of a stand-alone hybrid entirely renewable system comprising wind turbines, PV systems, bio-waste units, and storage devices to supply electrical and thermal loads simultaneously was investigated in this paper. A parking lot for electric vehicles is also considered in non-smart and smart charging strategies. In addition, a redefined scenario-based stochastic optimization is utilized to consider uncertainties in electrical and thermal loads, EVs' parameters, and renewable energy resources. The proposed approach is implemented on a small system in Espoo, Finland. The results confirm its efficiency for economically and uninterrupted supplying electrical and thermal demands simultaneously in a stand-alone hybrid system with entirely renewable resources. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the planning and operation of an energy district that aims to integrate a hydrogen supply chain for feeding vehicles based on fuel cell technology. A model of an energy district and an optimization algorithm based on the economic parameters are presented and validated leveraging an existing energy district, simulating several scenarios depending on different economic conditions and technical parameters. The model of the energy district evaluates energy balances, distinguishing hydrogen and electrical energy flows; the districts can include an FCEV fleet, electrical loads, energy generators, storage system and an electrolyser for producing hydrogen from the green energy surplus produced in the district as well as drawing energy from the power distribution network. The algorithm, based on MILP, is used for optimizing the flows in the district; indeed, it evaluates all the technical and economic constraints at a certain timestamp and provides optimal scheduling of the energy units. Model and algorithm have been used to evaluate different scenarios that were identified by varying the economic parameters (i.e., prices of electrical energy and hydrogen) as well as district design (i.e., upgrading sizes of the generators and electrolysers). Energy district parameters have been identified exploiting real data collected in an existing district located in Terni (Italy) owned by the local multi-utility ASM Terni S.p.A. It already includes a fleet for waste management, PV plants, office buildings and warehouses. Through parameters combination, 1125 OPEX and 729 CAPEX simulated scenarios have been evaluated and reported; each scenario assesses the daily variation of variables' economic trends covering the timeframe from 2030 to 2050. Results of simulations highlight the most convenient economic contexts as well as the envisioned amount of expenditures for adopting FCEV in the presented district or similar ones. For the case study, the forecasted cost of the hydrogen district, including FCEVs, is fully comparable to current costs, resulting in some cases even cheaper. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The most challenging aspect of developing a green hydrogen economy is long-distance oceanic transportation. Hydrogen liquefaction is a transportation alternative. However, the cost and energy consumption for liquefaction is currently prohibitively high, creating a major barrier to hydrogen supply chains. This paper proposes using solid nitrogen or oxygen as a medium for recycling cold energy across the hydrogen liquefaction supply chain. When a liquid hydrogen (LH2) carrier reaches its destination, the regasification process of the hydrogen produces solid nitrogen or oxygen. The solid nitrogen or oxygen is then transported in the LH2 carrier back to the hydrogen liquefaction facility and used to reduce the energy consumption cooling gaseous hydrogen. As a result, the energy required to liquefy hydrogen can be reduced by 25.4% using N2 and 27.3% using O2. Solid air hydrogen liquefaction (SAHL) can be the missing link for implementing a global hydrogen economy. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {One key strategy to achieve global climate targets is implementing climate-friendly hydrogen as a versatile energy carrier, commodity, and feedstock in the most energy-intensive sectors. Transmission pipeline networks are suited particularly for connecting primary hydrogen producers and consumers over medium distances to meet the future hydrogen demand in regions that strongly rely on energy imports. Nonetheless, the development and operation of large-scale hydrogen pipeline networks may have various yet unknown impacts on the environment. This work investigates the energetic efficiency and the environmental performance of hydrogen transport via pipeline by means of thermodynamic analysis and life cycle assessment. Pertinent technical specifications for large-scale hydrogen pipeline networks were derived based on the current design of state-of-the-art hydrogen pipelines and compressor stations. Since the energy-efficient operation of the pipeline network is essential for a climate-friendly hydrogen transport, thermodynamic analyses were performed to determine the resulting energy demand. Depending on the impact category considered, there are advantages and trade-offs in aiming for an energy-efficient as well as environmentally friendly hydrogen transport solution. The most decisive parameters to reach these aims are the condition of the line pipe's inner layer, the applied load capacity, as well as the compression ratios, -stages and -positioning. By varying these parameters and considering multiple transport variants, we recommend three measures for the design and operation of new or repurposed hydrogen pipelines: 1) Installing new smooth line pipes or cleaning existing ones to minimize the roughness of the inner surface; 2) Moderately reducing the load capacity, and 3) Shortening the transport intervals by installing intermediate compressor stations. Ultimately, reducing pressure losses within the pipeline system is crucial for ensuring an energetically efficient as well as environmentally friendly hydrogen transmission via large-scale pipeline networks. © 2022},

The results show that adding hydrogen capacity to the wind farm is profitable when hydrogen price is greater than $3.58/kg, and that the optimal day ahead market bidding strategy changes as hydrogen price changes. The results also suggest that both the addition of a fuel cell to reconvert stored hydrogen to electricity and the addition of a battery to smooth the electricity input to the electrolyzer are suboptimal for the system in the case of this study. The profit of a particular bidding scenario is most sensitive to the selling price of hydrogen, and then the input parameters of the electrolyzer.

	abstract = {In response to the Paris Agreement, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy resources (RER) is one of the most crucial measures in responding to climate change. Under this context, hydrogen storage with the concept of ‘power to gas’ represents a possible solution for the mismatch problem between fluctuating RER generation and downstream demand in a seasonal time scale. Compared to conventional low storage capacities of salt caverns, widely spread aquifers provide a possibility for safe, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly long-term hydrogen storage. However, current knowledge of hydrogen storage in these aquifers is only limited to a few impure hydrogen projects; understanding their trapping mechanisms as well as how to recover their trapped hydrogen is urgent. In order to fulfil the knowledge gap, not only are the complex underground interactions of hydrogen with rock or a fluid (residual trapping or dissolution trapping) modelled and validated against reliable experimental data, but also multiple cycles and cushion gas injection are integrated to enhance hydrogen recovery in this study. Through powerful numerical studies, the results indicate that: (a) at a seasonal storage time scale, residual trapping has the most effect in reducing hydrogen round-trip efficiency; (b) multiple cycles are helpful for hydrogen storage in an aquifer reservoir with round-trip efficiency increasing from 50.9% in the first cycle to 78.6% at the end; (c) nitrogen as a cushion gas for injection has a better performance compared with carbon dioxide with a capability to unlock residual trapped and dissolution trapped hydrogen; (d) nitrogen as a cushion gas for injection can effectively alleviate insufficient hydrogen production capacity in the first cycle with the hydrogen round-trip efficiency increased from 50% to 70%; and (e) the hydrogen extraction phase ends up with a very high recovery efficiency (around 85%) in a nitrogen injection scenario. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recently, researchers in the power system industry have considered the intelligent parking lot idea. The intelligent parking lots (IPL) try to exchange power with the upstream by electric vehicles (EVs) charge/discharge application. The mentioned process of charge/discharge can provide a solution model of regular problems in this field, i.e., peak time problems. Additionally, such vehicles' existence can play an essential role in environmental performance enhancement in power systems. The primary purpose of this paper is to consider such enhancements of EVs in power systems and environmental performance. For this purpose, a multi-objective optimization approach is suggested for the environmental performance and economical operation of IPL by considering the time-of-use rates of a demand response program. Since such a model is associated with various practical bounds, the multi-objective grasshopper optimization algorithm is suggested to solve this problem. The outcomes indicate the effectiveness of the compared techniques utilizing fuzzy decision-making strategies. Chaos theory is employed to increase this method and progress searching operators. Additionally, the proposed multi-objective technique is a model created using fuzzy theory, variable detection, strategy selection-based memory, and non-dominated sorting theory to choose the best Pareto from a list of solutions with robust functionality for resolving the problems mentioned above. The proposed technique is tested on a sample system that includes an intelligent parking lot, local production facilities, and non-renewable and renewable production systems under the proposed uncertainty strategy of upstream grid pricing. The study showed the effectiveness of the suggested method. The simulation findings indicate that the emission rate and overall cost of intelligent parking lots are reduced by 3.87 and 2%. It indicates that economic and environmental objectives are also satisfied due to the successful deployment of a demand response program. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Much of the analysis of hydrogen until this point has focused predominantly on hydrogen production. This paper aims to address this by developing a flexible techno-economic analysis (TEA) tool that can be used to evaluate the potential of future scenarios where hydrogen is produced, stored, and distributed within a region. The tool takes a full year of hourly data for renewables availability and dispatch down (the sum of curtailment and constraint), wholesale electricity market prices, and hydrogen demand, as well as other user-defined inputs, and sizes electrolyser capacity in order to minimise cost. The model is applied to a number of case studies on the island of Ireland, which includes Ireland and Northern Ireland. For the scenarios analysed, the overall LCOH ranges from €2.75–3.95/kgH2. Higher costs for scenarios without access to geological storage indicate the importance of cost-effective storage to allow flexible hydrogen production to reduce electricity costs whilst consistently meeting a set demand. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Population growth and the expansion of industries have increased energy demand and the use of fossil fuels as an energy source, resulting in release of greenhouse gases (GHG) and increased air pollution. Countries are therefore looking for alternatives to fossil fuels for energy generation. Using hydrogen as an energy carrier is one of the most promising alternatives to replace fossil fuels in electricity generation. It is therefore essential to know how hydrogen is produced. Hydrogen can be produced by splitting the water molecules in an electrolyser, using the abondand water resources, which are covering around ⅔ of the Earth's surface. Electrolysers, however, require high-quality water, with conductivity in the range of 0.1–1 μS/cm. In January 2018, there were 184 offshore oil and gas rigs in the North Sea which may be excellent sites for hydrogen production from seawater. The hydrogen production process reported in this paper is based on a proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser with an input flow rate of 300 L/h. A financially optimal system for producing demineralized water from seawater, with conductivity in the range of 0.1–1 μS/cm as the input for electrolyser, by WAVE (Water Application Value Engine) design software was studied. The costs of producing hydrogen using the optimised system was calculated to be US$3.51/kg H2. The best option for low-cost power generation, using renewable resources such as photovoltaic (PV) devices, wind turbines, as well as electricity from the grid was assessed, considering the location of the case considered. All calculations were based on assumption of existing cable from the grid to the offshore, meaning that the cost of cables and distribution infrastructure were not considered. Models were created using HOMER Pro (Hybrid Optimisation of Multiple Energy Resources) software to optimise the microgrids and the distributed energy resources, under the assumption of a nominal discount rate, inflation rate, project lifetime, and CO2 tax in Norway. Eight different scenarios were examined using HOMER Pro, and the main findings being as follows: The cost of producing water with quality required by the electrolyser is low, compared with the cost of electricity for operation of the electrolyser, and therefore has little effect on the total cost of hydrogen production (less than 1%). The optimal solution was shown to be electricity from the grid, which has the lowest levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of the options considered. The hydrogen production cost using electricity from the grid was about US$ 5/kg H2. Grid based electricity resulted in the lowest hydrogen production cost, even when costs for CO2 emissions in Norway, that will start to apply in 2025 was considered, being approximately US$7.7/kg H2. From economical point of view, wind energy was found to be a more economical than solar. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen is increasingly considered a vital element for the long-term decarbonization of the global energy system. For regions with scarce land resources, this means importing significant volumes of green hydrogen from regions with abundance of renewable energy. In producing countries, this raises significant sustainability questions related to production and export. To assess these sustainability-related opportunities and challenges, the authors first present a review of renewable energy deployment in the electricity sector, and then extend it to the foreseeable opportunities and risks of green hydrogen production in exporting countries. The paper finds that questions of freshwater and land availability are critical from an environmental and a socio-economic point of view, and that the development of international standards for the governance of hydrogen-related projects will be crucial. These should also address potential conflicts between the deployment of renewable energy for the decarbonization of local power grids, and the export of green hydrogen. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The recent strong increase in the penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in medium-voltage distribution grids (MVDNs) has raised the need for congestion management in such grids, as they were not designed for this new condition. This paper examines to what extent producing green hydrogen through electrolyzers can profitably contribute to congestion alleviation in MVDNs in the presence of high amounts of RES, as well as flexible consumers of electricity and a local heat system. To address this issue, an incentive-based method for improving flexibility in MVDNs is used which is based on a single-leader–multiple-followers game formulated by bi-level mathematical programming. At the upper level, the distribution system operator, who is the leader of this game, determines dynamic prices as incentives at each node based on the levels of generation and load. Next, at the lower level, providers of flexibility, including producers using electrolyzers, price-responsive power consumers, heat consumers, as well as heat producers, respond to these incentives by reshaping their output and consumption patterns. The model is applied to a region in the North of The Netherlands. The obtained results demonstrate that converting power to hydrogen can be an economically efficient way to reduce congestion in MVDNs when there is a high amount of RES. However, the economic value of electrolyzers as providers of flexibility to MVDNs decreases when more other options for flexibility provision exist. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Urban population and the trend towards online commerce leads to an increase in delivery solution in cities. The growth of the transport sector is very harmful to the environment, being responsible for approximately 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. The problem is aggravated when transporting perishable foodstuffs, as the vehicle propulsion engine (VPE) must power not only the vehicle but also the refrigeration unit. This means that the VPE must be running continuously, both on the road and stationary (during delivery), as the cold chain must be preserved. The result is costly (high fuel consumption) and harmful to the environment. At present, refrigerated transport does not support full-electric solutions, due to the high energy consumption required, which motivates the work presented in this article. It presents a turnkey solution of a hydrogen-powered refrigeration system (HPRS) to be integrated into standard light trucks and vans for short-distance food transport and delivery. The proposed solution combines an air-cooled polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), a lithium-ion battery and low-weight pressurised hydrogen cylinders to minimise cost and increase autonomy and energy density. In addition, for its implementation and integration, all the acquisition, power and control electronics necessary for its correct management have been developed. Similarly, an energy management system (EMS) has been developed to ensure continuity and safety in the operation of the electrical system during the working day, while maximizing both the available output power and lifetime of the PEMFC. Experimental results on a real refrigerated light truck provide more than 4 h of autonomy in intensive intercity driving profiles, which can be increased, if necessary, by simply increasing the pressure of the stored hydrogen from the current 200 bar to whatever is required. The correct operation of the entire HPRS has been experimentally validated in terms of functionality, autonomy and safety; with fuel savings of more than 10% and more than 3650 kg of CO2/year avoided. © 2023 The Author(s)},

(3) Implementation of H2-powered aviation into the macroeconomic data framework. The article presents an economy-wide database for analyzing H2-powered aviation. Subsequently, the paper highlights three H2 supply pathways, provides an exemplary techno-economic cost break-down for ten H2 components and translates them into the data framework. Eight relevant macroeconomic sectors for H2-powered aviation are identified and quantified. Overall, the paper contributes on a suitable foundation to apply the macroeconomic dataset and to conduct macroeconomic analyses on H2-powered aviation.

	abstract = {Renewable Energy Sources (RES) represent an attractive way to save natural resources and improve the overall impact of power systems on the environment. A continuous increase of share of RES in national energy mixes is observed, and due to the energy policy of the European Union and many other countries, further increase is expected. A disadvantage of RES is their random, weather-dependent availability, which requires energy storage. A promising method of integrating RES with the energy system is the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier (e.g. coupling RES with electrolyzers in order to directly use the renewable electricity for production of hydrogen). In the present work, a simulation of cooperation of a photovoltaic power plant with a gas piston engine fueled by hydrogen was performed, with and without the presence of energy storage. The aim of the analysis is twofold. First, the “compensation losses” due to forced part-load operation of the engine coupled with RES are evaluated and compared with “storage losses” resulting from the thermodynamic imperfectness of the storage; this allows to calculate the minimum round-trip efficiency of storage required for positive energy effect. The “compensation losses” have been determined to be of the order of magnitude of 2%, and the minimum round-trip efficiency of storage to be at the level of 85%. Second, a thermo-ecological analysis was carried out to determine the impact of the source of hydrogen on the overall ecological effectiveness of the system. Contrary to the commonly used measure of “energy efficiency” describing a local balance boundary, thermo-ecological cost (TEC) evaluates the consumption of non-renewable exergy within a global balance boundary. The analysis confirmed that comparing various hydrogen production methods (especially renewable and non-renewable) in terms of local energy efficiency is inadequate, because it does not tell much about their sustainability. For a hydrogen energy system basing on the water electrolysis – hydrogen transport/storage – combustion in a gas piston engine pathway to be considered sustainable, the input electricity to the electrolysis process should be characterized by TEC lower than ∼0.15 J∗/J, a value which even some renewable energy sources fail to achieve. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Various weight factors were assigned to understand the response of different optimization targets. The results highlight that the hybridization of energy resources allows the annual emissions to be cut by 68–78% for battery storage, 84–90% for hydrogen storage, compared to a diesel-only system. Despite having higher costs, the systems with hydrogen storage can store energy in the long term; therefore, they have lower CO2 emissions. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Nowadays the trend of increasing the generation units based on renewable energy sources in the electric power system can be observed. Obviously, this is due to the intensifying level of consumer load and demand for electricity. However, renewable generation is characterized by intermittent energy production, which can cause and potential imbalance between generation and demand, especially during off-peak periods. Therefore, in order to ensure a reliable power supply to consumers, it is necessary to use a maneuverable reserve of capacity, such as energy storage systems, in conjunction with the renewable energy source unit. Over the past 10 years, the energy storage market has grown by almost 50%: the installed capacity of energy storage system in the world is about 5 GW. Analysis of the literature on the subject determines the need to study the impact of these devices on the parameters of electric power systems and one of the primary tasks is to determine the optimal location and capacity of energy storage system in the power system. This paper presents the result of solving the task of determining the optimal parameters of a hydrogen energy storage system using the particle swarm optimization method for example a test scheme radial distribution system – 33 bus IEEE. The choice of the type of energy storage is based on such advantages of a hydrogen energy storage system as environmental friendliness, high energy capacity and the ability to store electricity for a long period of time. In addition, compared to lithium-ion batteries, hydrogen energy storage systems have a long life time of about 25 years, during this period of time there is no degradation and significant deterioration of its properties. All these advantages of hydrogen as an energy carrier allow to take into account not only the criterion of total value of active power losses and its maximum reduction respectively, but the possibility and economic efficiency of partial use of the stored hydrogen for other needs when determining the optimal scenario of their operation in the process of discharge. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

One of the concepts is that of energy islands, which entails the placement of energy conversion and storage equipment near offshore wind farms. Offshore placement of electrolysers will cause interdependence between the availability of electricity for hydrogen production and for power transmission to shore. This paper investigates the trade-offs between integrating energy islands via electricity versus hydrogen infrastructure. We set up a combined capacity expansion and electricity dispatch model to assess the role of electrolysers and electricity cables given the availability of renewable energy from the islands. We find that the electricity system benefits more from connecting close-to-shore wind farms via power cables. In turn, electrolysis is more valuable for far-away energy islands as it avoids expensive long-distance cable infrastructure. We also find that capacity investment in electrolysers is sensitive to hydrogen prices but less to carbon prices. The onshore network and congestion caused by increased activity close to shore influence the sizing and siting of electrolysers. © 2023 The Author(s)},

The general idea is to form hydrogen clusters integrated with storage and transportation. The paper focuses on the financial viability of the plants, presenting the results of economic evaluation together with sensitivity analysis for various economic factors. The analyzed case study proves that over a wide range of parameters alkaline electrolyzers show favorable economic characteristics, however, a PEM-based plant is more resilient to changes in the price of electricity, which is the main cost component in hydrogen generation. The study is enriched with an experimental investigation of low-pressure storage methods, based on porous metal hydride tanks. The effectiveness of the tanks (β) compared to pressurized hydrogen tanks, in the same volume and pressure is equal to β = 10.2. A solution is proposed whereby these can be used in a distributed hydrogen generation concept due to their safe and simple operation, without additional costly equipment, e.g., compressors. A method for evaluation of the avoided energy consumption as a function of the effectiveness of the tanks is developed. Avoided energy consumption resulting from implementing MH tanks equals 1.33 – 1.37 kWh per kilogram of hydrogen depending on the number of stages of a compressor. The methods proposed in this paper are universal and can be used for various green hydrogen facilities. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production via electrolysis is an efficient way to store excess energy from renewable energy plants, but electrolysis must be made more applicable. Conventional water electrolysis is complicated by a gas distribution and management system to prevent the mixing of H2 and O2 gases, which creates significant safety hazards. The use of membranes and diaphragms solves the gas mixing problem but reduces efficiency and directly affects the cost of hydrogen production. Here we show decoupled water electrolysis concept, where hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution are spatially and temporally separated using a WO3 charge storage electrode as a red-ox mediator. Electrolysis is realized in two steps, where in the first step the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and intercalation of H+ in the WO3 material take place. In the second step, the deintercalation of H+ from the WO3 material and the reduction of H+ to H at the other electrode takes place. In the electrolysis process H2 and O2 gasses are produced with purity >99.9%. The overall efficiency of the electrolyzer is 65%. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Recently, the theme of the “green transition”, in which the economic and commercial prospects of the hydrogen industry play a leading role, in the global energy industry has attracted special attention from business, government and scientific circles in many countries, which is associated with its predicted impact, incl. due to the climate agenda, to the economic, technological and geopolitical redistribution of the energy map of the world at the global and regional levels. Some slowdown in the “green transition” is expected due to the need to overcome the global energy crisis in the next two or three years, which may turn out to be more serious than the crisis of the 1970s of the last century which will require eliminating the shortage of traditional non-renewable energy resources in the near future. Nevertheless, the “green transition”, in which hydrogen accents are intensifying, continues to be implemented, which will have a serious impact on the system of international and international economic relations in the world. Thanks to the financial support of the state and business, modern technologies of the entire hydrogen energy chain are actively developing, hydrogen markets are being formed in the conditions of inter-fuel competition, as well as hydrogen energy command centers at the global, regional, country and corporate levels. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Designing cost-effective and high-efficiency non-noble electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a significant challenge for electrochemical water splitting to store clean and renewable energy. Herein, we have developed Ni–Fe–Sn electrocatalysts grown on Ni foam (Ni–Fe–Sn@NF) for the HER through a simple and facile synthetic route of cyclic voltammetry electrodeposition. The optimized Ni–Fe–Sn electrocatalysts possess excellent electrocatalysis toward hydrogen evolution with a low overpotential of 103 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, together with a small Tafel slope value of 97.4 mV·dec−1 in 1 M KOH. The electrocatalyst also features excellent stability even after 2000 cycles and strong durability after 50 h under alkaline condition. The high HER performance can be attributed to the moderately optimized electronic structure of the Ni, Fe, and Sn center and bind-free nature of the electrode, which facilitates electron transfer and speeds up reaction kinetics. Moreover, the improved electrochemical surface area also enhances the performance on hydrogen production. This strategy presents a facile and simple tactic for the synthesis of noble-metal-free electrocatalysts with excellent HER performance. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Utilizing renewable sources integrated with thermodynamic cycles has been gaining attention in recent years due to being economical and environment-friendly, among which, renewable-energy driven water and power generation systems have shown promising outcomes. In the field of renewable-energy based multi-generation systems (MGS), many recent works have focused on energy analysis or simple optimization. Therefore, in this study, an off-grid solar-geothermal cogeneration system which is able to produce power by Kalina cycle, hydrogen by proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMEC), and freshwater by a multi-effect desalination (MED) unit, was investigated and optimized in terms of economic and energy viewpoints. Unlike previous studies, in this work, a comprehensive multi-objective optimization (MOO) was employed on the system in order to find the optimal working condition. The decision variables of the optimization include flat plate collector area, water mass flow, and ammonia concentration of the Kalina cycle, and the objective functions were levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), payback period (PBP), the overall energy efficiency of the system, and freshwater production of MED unit. Final results show that the system, in its optimum condition, is able to produce 182.09 m3.day−1 fresh water, with energy efficiency, PBP, and LCOE equal to 6.23%, 5.19 years and 0.238 $.kWh−1, respectively. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen produced from intermittent renewable energy sources is a key component on the way to a carbon neutral planet. In order to achieve the most sustainable, efficient and cost-effective solutions, it is necessary to match the dimensioning of the renewable energy source, the capacity of the hydrogen production and the size of the hydrogen storage to the hydrogen demand of the application. For optimized dimensioning of a PV powered hydrogen production system, fulfilling a specific hydrogen demand, a detailed plant simulation model has been developed. In this study the model was used to conduct a parameter study to optimize a plant that should serve 5 hydrogen fuel cell buses with a daily hydrogen demand of 90 kg overall with photovoltaics (PV) as renewable energy source. Furthermore, the influence of the parameters PV system size, electrolyser capacity and hydrogen storage size on the hydrogen production costs and other key indicators is investigated. The plant primarily uses the PV produced energy but can also use grid energy for production. The results show that the most cost-efficient design primarily depends on the grid electricity price that is available to supplement the PV system if necessary. Higher grid electricity prices make it economically sensible to invest into higher hydrogen production and storage capacity. For a grid electricity price of 200 €/MWh the most cost-efficient design was found to be a plant with a 2000 kWp PV system, an electrolyser with 360 kW capacity and a hydrogen storage of 575 kg. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Thermal pretreatment converts cellulose in the substrate into glucose, and deactivates methanogens present in the consortium. A Rhinohide membrane separates the cathode chamber from the anode chamber of the MEC, which requires an external power supply of 0.6 V. In this study, we determine an economically optimal utilization option for H2 and the by-product CO2 by investigating 6 scenarios. Of the 6 scenarios, the option involving the combustion of H2 in a gas engine to produce electricity and CO2 sale is the most financially feasible. Several economic analyses were performed to identify the cost drivers of the H2 production in the economically optimal scenario.

This empirical investigation was performed based on 358 valid sample responses from the pan-India survey. Utilising structural equation modelling, the hypotheses were tested, and the research model was validated. The findings revealed that the adoption of HFCV has a positive impact on SDGs. The results confirm that policy implications significantly change public perception regarding high cost and infrastructure readiness. Keeping the finding in mind, we recommend that the fuel retailers create more hydrogen refuelling stations across the country to ease infrastructure bottlenecks. Further, governments at various levels should provide financial benefits to green hydrogen producers, fuel cell manufacturers, HFCV manufacturers, and early adopters of HFCVs in India. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

While identifying ideal locations for green hydrogen production is critical for countries when defining their green hydrogen strategies, there has been a paucity of adequate geospatial planning approaches suitable to low- and middle-income countries. It is essential for these countries to identify green hydrogen production sites which match demand to expected use cases such that their strategies are economically sustainable. This paper therefore develops a novel geospatial cost modelling method to optimize the location of green hydrogen production across different use cases, with a focus on suitability to low- and middle-income countries. This method is applied in Kenya to investigate the potential hydrogen supply chain for three use cases: ammonia-based fertilizer, freight transport, and export. We find hydrogen production costs of €3.7–9.9/kgH are currently achievable across Kenya, depending on the production location chosen. The cheapest production locations are identified to the south and south-east of Lake Turkana. We show that ammonia produced in Kenya can be cost-competitive given the current energy crisis and that Kenya could export hydrogen to Rotterdam with costs of €7/kgH, undercutting current market prices regardless of the carrier medium. With expected techno-economic improvements, hydrogen production costs across Kenya could drop to €1.8–3.0/kgH by 2030. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Grid-connected hybrid hydrogen refuelling and electric vehicle charging microgrids with on-site hydrogen production, battery and hydrogen energy storages and renewable energy can help to solve these challenges. We investigate the influence of various microgrid design and operation strategies regarding their contribution to profitability and decarbonisation in an optimisation study.

	abstract = {Microgrids with high shares of variable renewable energy resources, such as wind, experience intermittent and variable electricity generation that causes supply–demand mismatches over multiple timescales. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and hydrogen (H2) are promising technologies for short- and long-duration energy storage, respectively. A hybrid LIB-H2 energy storage system could thus offer a more cost-effective and reliable solution to balancing demand in renewable microgrids. Recent literature has modeled these hybrid storage systems; however, it remains unknown how anticipated, but uncertain, cost reductions and performance improvements will impact overall system cost and composition in the long term. Here, we developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for sizing the components (wind turbine, electrolyser, fuel cell, hydrogen storage, and lithium-ion battery) of a 100% wind-supplied microgrid in Canada. Compared to using just LIB or H2 alone for energy storage, the hybrid storage system was found to provide significant cost reductions. A sensitivity analysis showed that components of the H2 subsystem meaningfully impact the total microgrid cost, while the impact of the LIB subsystem is dominated by its energy storage capacity costs. Regarding efficiency, decreased electrolyzer efficiency causes the greatest increase in total system cost, whereas increased fuel cell efficiency has the greatest potential to reduce total system cost. As technologies evolve, the H2 subsystem assumes a greater role (i.e., it is larger and receives/supplies more energy over more hours) compared to the LIB subsystem, but LIB continues to provide frequent intra-day balancing in the microgrid. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

We propose linear reserve constraints with adjustable parameters within the planning model to address the reliability requirements from significant levels of variable renewable generation. These adjustable parameters are calibrated using an iterative training methodology that connects the long-term planning model with a short-term unit commitment model. A crucial aspect of our methodology is the iterative improvement of investment decisions through the feedback obtained by evaluating the operational performance of the investment decisions in different scenarios computed under the unit commitment model. Computational experiments in a case study of a large-scale Chilean power-hydrogen system show the effects of the proposed methodology on capacity expansion recommendations, where a correct balance between variable and flexible technologies is obtained. Moreover, when simulating the operation of the system for a full year, we observe that the proposed methodology generates an investment plan that achieves a lower total cost compared to other methodologies commonly used in the literature. Additional experiments in 100% renewable scenarios show how conventional methodologies reaches levels of not-supplied-energy between 2%–7%, while the proposed methodology achieves less than 1% in the same metric. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

While the cost of grid energy is driven by the energy prices, onsite renewable investments are driven by the levelized cost of renewable energy. Energy prices can widely vary in time and in different locations, potentially having a large impact on the annualized cost of hydrogen (ACOH). Renewable sources can also vary significantly for different locations and seasons. In this paper, we develop a semi-empirical model to find key ACOH locational drivers and trends. The model finds the optimal capacity of the onsite solar and wind generators and the electrolyzer, together with the optimal use of grid energy.

Based on the perspective of renewable energy generators (REGs), this study seeks the dynamic optimal configuration and comprehensive benefits of adding HRS and battery to existing EVCS considering the travel rules of new energy vehicles (NEVs). The results show that (1) It is profitable for REGs to invest in HRSs; (2) The economy of investment in batteries by REGs depends on the source-load matching.

	abstract = {The application of energy storage technologies is crucial to the extensive exploitation of renewable energy for power generation in off-grid areas because energy storage can mitigate the intermittency of renewables and balance the supply–demand mismatch. A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) with two or more heterogenous and supplementary energy storages outperforms single energy storage from the perspective of reliability and cost-effectiveness, but how to select the optimal HESS configuration is still unknown. To this end, this paper investigates the techno-economic comparison of ten HESSs in off-grid renewable energy system applications, including all pairwise combinations of thermal energy storage, pumped hydro storage, hydrogen storage, battery, and supercapacitor. Moreover, a novel probabilistic reliability index called loss of power supply probability with probability of exceedance (LPSP-PoE) is proposed to quantitatively handle the long-term uncertainties of renewable energy resources. The rule-based coordinated energy management strategies considering the charging/discharging priority and optimized operating thresholds are established for different HESSs, and then the multi-objective optimization models aiming to minimize net present cost and LPSP-PoE are developed to search the optimal components sizing and operating thresholds simultaneously. Finally, the results of case studies show that: (1) the optimal net present cost of thermal energy storage-battery at the highest reliability level is 3.3472 billion USD, which is 6.98 %∼69.85 % lower than the figure for other HESSs, indicating that thermal energy storage-battery is the most cost-effective HESS configuration; (2) The optimal charging/discharging priority can lead to 29.6 %∼75.2 % cost reduction, and the optimal operating thresholds can always achieve the lowest LPSP, illustrating the superiority of the proposed operation strategies; (3) the techno-economic performance of all HESSs varies significantly with the PoE level and load profile, while their rankings remain basically unchanged, showing the robustness of the comparison results. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The Platinum catalytic electrode is widely applied in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of water due to its low overpotential. However, it has affected its commercial application because of its high cost. Therefore, developing heterojunction catalysts with Platinum for HER is an effective way to achieve large-scale hydrogen production. In this work, we present a novel PtNBs/NiNRs heterojunction catalyst via the Pt nanoballs in-situ deposition on Ni nanorods array. The results demonstrate that the PtNBs/NiNRs electrodes have superior catalytic activity for HER in an alkaline condition. The hydrogen overpotential of PtNBs/NiNRs is −61.6 mV (RHE) in the alkaline solution, which is lower than the Pt electrode of −184mV. The Tafel plots and EIS were employed to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of the PtNBs/NiNRs in the alkaline solution. The nanostructures of Ni nanorobs and the Pt nanoballs active sites decrease the charge transfer resistance and increase the charge capacitance for the HER process compared to the Pt electrode. The PtNBs/NiNRs heterojunction catalyst electrodes demonstrate promising applications in HER because of their facile preparation, high efficiency, and low value. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {One of the important alternatives to conventional fossil fuel vehicles in the transportation sector is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV) technology. One of the most significant obstacles to the widespread use of these vehicles is the hydrogen supply chain network (HSC) infrastructure. In the design of this network, the harm caused by the network to the environment and the security risks that may arise are as important as the associated cost of building it. In this study, an HSC design that will minimize cost, carbon emission and security risk for Turkey is proposed. The problem is modeled using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Five different optimization cases are studied when the penetration rate of HFCV is 25%. In the first three cases, the objectives are independently optimized. The multi-objective optimization is addressed in Case 4 and Case 5. Case 4 is solved with epsilon constraint method by employing the results of the first three cases. The most balanced solution found is 88%, 10% and 2% away from the best cost, carbon emission and risk values, respectively. It is observed that the proposed solution has a decentralized network structure where steam methane reforming (SMR) and electrolysis (ELE) production plants are established. In Case 5, the weighted sum method (another multi-objective optimization method) is used and those which gave the closest results to that of the epsilon constraint method are chosen as the associated weights of three objectives. Using these weights, 10 different demand scenarios are studied. It is observed that the HSC has a decentralized structure under almost all demand scenarios. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Hydrogen for electricity production is beneficial only in limited quantities to restrict biomass consumption, but increases the system costs due to losses.

The industry sector may benefit from hydrogen to reduce biomass at a lower cost than in the other energy sectors, but electrification and e-methane may be more feasible.

	abstract = {In this paper, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to design a hybrid PV-hydrogen renewable energy system considering two objective functions; minimizing total life costs and loss probability of power supply. The decisions of the hybrid system include the number of PV panels, the number of hydrogen tanks, the number of electrolyzers, the number of fuel cells, and quantity of hydrogen stored over time. An exact method embedded in GAMS software is used to solve the developed model. The model is validated using an electrical testing lab in Saudi Arabia with hourly power demand. Different plans are chosen from the obtained optimal Pareto solutions. For example, one of the plans found that a hybrid system with 212 PV panels, 617 hydrogen tanks, 30 electrolyzers, and 21 fuel cells is sufficient to satisfy the electrical testing lab load with an annual cost of $61663, the loss of power supply probability is 10%, and the CO2 saving of 214,882 kg of CO2. The results indicated the feasibility of combining an electrolyzer, hydrogen tank storage, and fuel cell with a renewable energy system; however, the cost of energy generated is still high because of the high investment cost. Furthermore, the findings revealed that hydrogen technologies are appealing as an energy storage solution for intermittent renewable energy systems and in other applications such as transportation, residential, and industrial sectors. In addition, the findings demonstrated the possibility of using renewable energy as a source of energy, namely, in Saudi Arabia. However, weather conditions, geomorphological conditions, and climatic dependence on hydrogen fuel cell technology can harm the energy yields produced by renewable energy systems. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

By introducing hydrogen production, storage and conversion devices into the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system to replace its fossil fuel components, the hydrogen-involved total renewable energy CCHP (H-RE-CCHP) system is formed, thus bringing an effective way to promote energy transition towards low carbon. However, the conflict between economy and environment, and interference of source-load uncertainties hinder the low-cost construction as well as economic, stable, and low-carbon operation of H-RE-CCHP. In view of this, this paper proposes a multi-objective distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for H-RE-CCHP planning. Firstly, a moment-based ambiguity set is constructed to define the possible range for the joint distribution of solar irradiation and multiple loads. Secondly, considering the “worst-case” distribution within the ambiguity set, the economic and environmental objective functions are presented for minimizing system construction, maintenance and operation costs while reducing carbon emission. Furthermore, the sizing- and operation-related constraints are formulated according to such principles as maintaining multi-energy balance when the forecasting errors of uncertainties occur. Finally, by applying strong duality and augmented ε-constraint for model solving, Pareto optimal solution set is obtained, and from which final planning and operation scheme is selected according to decision preference and interactions between objectives. Simulations mainly verify: 1) due to considering multiple objectives, H-RE-CCHP planning and operation reach the reasonable trade-off between economy and environment, that is, carbon emission/economic cost can be reduced by 99.81 %/66.70 % comparing with single economic/environmental objective; 2) with applying DRO in resisting uncertainties, 100 % renewable energy accommodation is achieved while meeting stable H-RE-CCHP operation; etc. Accordingly, this paper provides an effective approach for renewable energy system planning, thus contributing to the low carbon development of economic society. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A critical requirement of a widely contemplated hydrogen economy is the development of a low carbon hydrogen supply chain that is cost competitive. This comprehensive techno-economic assessment demonstrates, for the first time, the viability of a complete hydrogen supply chain based on the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This is demonstrated via the established LNG trade route from Australia to Japan against three key performance indicators (KPIs): delivered hydrogen cost, CO2 emissions intensity (EI) across the entire supply chain, and technology readiness level (TRL). The hydrogen supply chain entails LNG export to Japan where it is used for blue hydrogen production; the by-product CO2 is then liquefied and repatriated to Australia for sequestration or utilisation. Within this supply chain, various hydrogen production technologies are assessed, including steam methane reforming (SMR), autothermal reforming (ATR) and natural gas pyrolysis (NGP). SMR with carbon capture and storage (CCS) resulted in the lowest total hydrogen supply cost of 19 USD/GJ (2.3 USD/kgH2) which comfortably meets the 2030 Japanese hydrogen cost target of 25 USD/GJ (3 USD/kgH2) and is very close to the 17 USD/GJ 2050 Japanese hydrogen cost target. This technology also obtained the lowest CO2 emission intensity (EI) of 38 kgCO2/GJ (4.5 kgCO2/kgH2); this was surprisingly lower than ATR with CCS primarily due to the emissions associated with ATR electricity provision for air separation. Future technologies and strategies are detailed so as to further reduce cost and supply chain emissions; these were shown to be able to reduce total CO2 EI to 14 kgCO2/GJ (1.6 kgCO2/kgH2). Hence this analysis indicates that this supply chain can act to significantly reduce CO2 emissions whilst uniquely meeting targeted hydrogen supply costs up to 2050. As such it is proposed here as an eminently viable hydrogen export option deploying both existing technology and capacity, at least until other hydrogen supply chain vectors (such as liquid hydrogen and ammonia) derived from green hydrogen production become competitive across all the KPIs. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The growing recognition of the value of hydrogen as an energy intermediate in supporting future power systems with high shares of variable renewable energy has prompted many studies to quantify the economic potential of multi-output hybrid systems, which are one type of integrated energy systems (IES). Because of the complexity of modeling multiple sectors, these studies typically use simplified modeling approaches to capture the interactions between sectors. In this study, we explore the implications of alternative modeling approaches for nuclear-hydrogen IES focusing on a power system in the Midwest United States. We combine highly resolved capacity expansion and production cost modeling tools of the power system with a detailed hydrogen system optimization tool to determine the optimal electrolyzer and storage sizing and optimal operations of the nuclear-hydrogen hybrid resource across three future study years. We compare economic and operational outcomes across a spectrum of modeling approaches, including a non-hybridized base approach; a traditional price-taker approach that does not include the impact of hydrogen production on the electricity system; a power-system-focused price-maker approach that does not account for temporal hydrogen constraints; and two improved price-taker and price-maker approaches that each address the impact of revenue-optimal levels of electricity production on the resulting power system and temporal hydrogen constraints on the overall feasible solution. Results show how a traditional price-taker approach can overestimate the economic benefits of multi-output nuclear-hydrogen IES compared to our two improved approaches that estimate both hydrogen system constraints and power system interaction. We find that hydrogen output requirements and storage size limits are key drivers to overall operations and some economic outcomes. Under our assumed constant hydrogen output requirement, storage costs, test system, and modeling approaches, our results indicate that hybridization can provide a net benefit, but results are sensitive to the treatment of hydrogen revenues and electricity prices as impacted by the power system evolution. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sector coupling will play a key role in the future energy system to realise greenhouse gas emission reductions. A major factor will be green hydrogen based on renewable energies to defossilise consumption sectors. Related business models of power to gas are not yet implemented on the market. However, given the urgency of the change, this is essential. This paper investigates hydrogen business models under current market conditions of high power prices, no existing market for green hydrogen and the given regulatory framework with no levies for green hydrogen production in the German market. For this purpose, an open-source business model evaluation tool for sector coupling, which enables a simple and generic evaluation of sector coupling business models including production and possible transportation infrastructure, is developed and applied. Furthermore, the impact of changes of the input parameters like power prices and the influence of regulatory changes on profitability are assessed. The results show that X-to-power business cases can be already profitable due to high power prices on the wholesale market. However, power-to-X business models like hydrogen production still have negative net present values and the net present value is worsened when infrastructure for hydrogen transportation is considered. Key parameters for the negative result are investment costs and low hydrogen prices. Nevertheless, it must be considered that higher hydrogen prices have a negative impact on the X-to-power business model. To allow for profitable business cases, the market conditions need to be adjusted to ensure sufficiently high prices for green hydrogen. Furthermore, subsidies on investment or operational and maintenance costs can support the integration of power-to-X into the market. Transportation infrastructure has a significant impact on profitability. Given these facts, it is necessary to create the required framework conditions to ensure the realisation of sector coupling. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Electrofuels, including hydrogen, methane and ammonia, have been suggested as one pathway in achieving net-zero greenhouse gas energy systems. They can play a role in providing an energy storage and fuel or feedstock to hard-to-abate sectors. In future energy systems their role is often studied in case studies adhering to specific region. In this study we study their role by defining multiple archetypal energy systems, which represent approximations of real systems in different regions. Comparing the role of electrofuels across the cost-optimized systems relying only on renewable energy in power generation, we found that hydrogen was a significant energy vector in all systems, with its annual quantity approaching the classic electricity demand. The role of renewable methane was very limited. Electrofuel storages were needed in all systems and their capacity was the highest in the northern Hemiboreal system. Absence of cavern storage potential did not hamper the significance of electrofuels but increased the role of ammonia and led to average 5.5 % systemic cost increase. Systems where reservoir hydropower was scarce or level of electricity consumption was high, needed more fuel storages. The findings of this study can help for better understanding of what kind of storage and generation technologies will be most useful in future carbon-neutral systems in different types of regions. © 2023 The Authors},

The emergence of renewable energy resources, along with multi-career users, requires multi-career systems. In this regard, the energy hub (EH) as an integrated system can be used to increase the reliability of the system. The power-to-gas (P2G) and P2G storage are two practical technologies to achieve high efficiency in energy systems. In this paper, the contribution is optimal scheduling of stochastic problem in EH system amalgamated with CHP unit, P2G storage, thermal storage, boiler, wind power, and electrical storage to supply the heat, gas, and power loads by regarding demand response program (DRP). For the electrical loads, the load shifting strategy is considered to minimize the operational cost of the EH system. In order to manage related uncertainties about electricity price, wind power, and electrical loads, the downside risk constraint (DRC) method is applied to investigate the EH system function. According to the obtained results, by increasing approximately 2.8% of the operational cost, the risk level can be reduced remarkably.

Achieving economically competitive hydrogen production costs is a major challenge in times of an energy price crisis. Our objective is to show the economically optimal installed capacity of electrolysers in relation to wind and solar power so swift and credible statements can be made regarding the system design. The ratio between renewable generation and electrolysis power as well as scaling effects, operating behaviour and development of costs are considered. Hydrogen production costs are calculated for four exemplary real PV and wind sites and different ratios of electrolysis to renewable power for the year 2020. The ideal ratio for PV systems is between 14% and 73% and for wind between 3.3% and 143% for low and high full load hours. The lowest hydrogen production costs are identified at 2.53 €/kg for 50 MW wind power and 72 MW electrolysis power. The results provide plant constructors the possibility to create a cost-optimized design via an optimum ratio of electrolysis to renewable capacity.

	abstract = {Fission Batteries (FBs) are nuclear reactors for customers with heat demands less than 250 MWt—replacing oil and natural gas in a low-carbon economy. Individual FBs would have outputs between 5 and 30 MWt. The small FB size has two major benefits: (1) the possibility of mass production and (2) ease of transport and leasing with return of used FBs to factory for refurbishing and reuse. Comparatively, these two features are lacking in larger conventional reactors. Larger reactors are not transportable and thus can't obtain the manufacturing economics possible with mass production or the operational advantages of returning the FB to the factory after use. Leasing places the regulatory, maintenance and fuel-cycle burden on the leasing company that is minimized by large-fleet operations of identical units. The markets and economic requirements for FBs were examined. The primary existing markets are industrial, biofuels, off-grid electricity and container ships. Two major future markets were identified—advanced biofuels and hydrogen. In a low-carbon world, the competitive price range for heat is $20–50/MWh ($6–15/million BTU) and $70–115/MWh for non-grid electricity. The primary competition in these sectors is likely to be biofuels and hydrogen produced using alternative energy sources—grid electricity is non-competitive. Larger users of energy have alternative low-carbon energy choices including modular nuclear reactors and fossil fuels with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Establishing integrated energy systems is conducive for improving renewable energy utilization and promoting decarbonization. In this study, a grid-connected photovoltaic-hydrogen-natural gas integrated energy system is established to explore the effects of the configuration of the integrated energy system on its environment and economy. A multi-objective hierarchical optimization allocation model is developed, and an optimization strategy with carbon emission superior to total cost is established for the first time. Additionally, the economy, environment, and energy efficiency of the system are analyzed. A comparative study is performed using a strategy considering that the total cost is superior to carbon emission. A case study reveals that the levelized cost of electricity increases by 62.24%, levelized carbon emission of power decreases by 74.19%, and energy efficiency increases by 8.51%, as compared with those of the comparison strategy. Thus, the carbon emission of the system is reduced considerably, and the energy efficiency is improved. Although the cost of the system optimized by the proposed strategy is higher, it is economically feasible. Further analyses indicate that extending the grid-connected period would be infeasible, as it might increase the total cost and carbon emission of the system. Moreover, sensitivity analyses show that increasing the natural gas price or carbon tax base price will not reduce the carbon emission of the system. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Due to accelerating global efforts toward decarbonization, a clean hydrogen (H2) producing technology, Microbial Electrolysis Cell (MEC), has garnered considerable attention. However, MEC's external energy requirement has raised concerns about its sustainability, scalability and application costs. The objective of this research was to build a renewable energy generating system for MECs' performance enhancement during the treatment of Palm oil mill effluent (POME). A novel integration of a pico-hydro-power generator (PHP) with single-chambered MECs exceptionally improved its performance. The performance boost was observed as 1.16 m3-H2/m3d H2 and 113 A/m3current production in concomitant with 73% organics removal from Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) wastewater, which is higher than the previous single-chambered MECs studies. 78% H2 recovery rcat (H2) along with 57% coulombic efficiency (CE) corroborated the removal of a high percentage of electrons from POME organic materials to generate >96% pure H2. The MEC nourished POME wastewater degrading communities while stimulating growth of electroactive Geobacter in the anodic biofilm which produced H2. The overall H2 recovery, COD removal rate and energy efficiency of PHP-MEC are superior than other MECs powered by other external renewable energy sources reported to date. The PHP-MEC prototype paves the path of scale up studies to build a renewable energy dependent future. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production by electrolysis technology spurs as extensive investigation toward new clear energy acquisition. The mainstream hydrogen production electrolyzers, including alkaline electrolyzer (ALK), anion exchange membrane electrolyzer (AEM), and proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEM), are traced to compare their current and future hydrogen production cost regarding technology development. Technologies' characteristics are originally described as the polarization curve parameters such as current density, overpotential, and polarization curve slope. The feature of crucial materials such as catalysts and membranes are also taken into consideration. Then, a bottom-up hydrogen production cost prediction model stemming from technical factors is established with a combination of manufacturing and operating considerations. According to model predictions, the cost of hydrogen production of ALK will be 23.85% and 51.59% lower than AEM and PEM technologies in the short term. However, under technological advancement or breakthrough, the hydrogen production cost of AEM and PEM is expected to be 24% and 56.5% lower in the medium-term and long-term, respectively. The lifetime of the electrolyzers is significantly vital to affect the cost of hydrogen production. The cost reduction space brought about by various technical factors is also explored for the blueprint planning of the hydrogen economy. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This system works to generate power, freshwater, and hydrogen, which consists of the following parts: the solar collectors, Steam Rankine subsystem, Organic Rankine subsystem, desalination part, and hydrogen production and compression unit. Initially, the effects of variables including reference temperature, solar radiation intensity, wind speed, and solar cycle mass flow rate, which depend on weather conditions and affect the performance of the integrated system, were investigated. The thermodynamic analysis results showed that the overall study's exergy efficiency, the rate of hydrogen and freshwater production, and total cost rate are 33.3%, 7.92 kg/h, 1.6398 kg/s, and 61.28 $/h, respectively. Also, the net power generation rate in the Steam and Organic Rankine subsystems and wind turbines are 315 kW, 326.52 kW, and 226 kW, respectively. The main goal of this study is to minimize the total cost rate of the system and maximize the exergy efficiency and hydrogen and freshwater production rate of the total system. The results of optimization showed that the exergy efficiency value improved by 20.7%, the hydrogen production rate increased by 1%, and the total cost rate value declined by 2%. Moreover, the optimum point is similar to a region in Hormozgan province, Iran. So, this region is proposed for building the power plant. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green energy commodities are expected to be central in decarbonising the global energy system. Such green energy commodities could be hydrogen or other hydrogen-based energy commodities produced from renewable energy sources (RES) such as solar or wind energy. We quantify the production cost and potentials of hydrogen and hydrogen-based energy commodities ammonia, methane, methanol, gasoline, diesel and kerosene in 113 countries. Moreover, we evaluate total supply costs to Germany, considering both pipeline-based and maritime transport. We determine production costs by optimising the investment and operation of commodity production from dedicated RES based on country-level RES potentials and country-specific weighted average costs of capital. Analysing the geographic distribution of production and supply costs, we find that production costs dominate the supply cost composition for liquid or easily liquefiable commodities, while transport costs dominate for gaseous commodities. In the case of Germany, importing green ammonia could be more cost-efficient than domestic production from locally produced or imported hydrogen. Green ammonia could be supplied to Germany from many regions worldwide at below the cost of domestic production, with costs ranging from 624 to 874 $/t NH3 and Norway being the cheapest supplier. Ammonia production using imported hydrogen from Spain could be cost-effective if a pan-European hydrogen pipeline grid based on repurposed natural gas pipelines exists. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {On Flores island (Azores, Portugal), energy production depends up to 47% on fossil fuels, namely Diesel. To minimize CO2 emissions, the dependency on fuel prices, and to mitigate the consequences of variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources, a new energy system, based on H2 storage was analysed. To achieve the optimal size of the system, a computer model was developed and a multi-objective genetic algorithm function was used to minimize three objectives: the difference of levelised cost of energy (△LCOE), CO2 emissions and the percentage of renewable energy dumped (RRES, dump). From the set of solutions obtained, one that meets RRES, dump ≤ 1%, lowest CO2 emissions and lowest △LCOE is chosen and an economical and energetic analysis is performed. The newly proposed system reduces Diesel consumption by 68,7% (1057487 L/year) and CO2 emissions by 65,9% (2455,1 CO2 tons/year) achieving a renewable energy sources (RES) penetration of 89% (36% increase), but fails to decrease the levelised cost of energy (56,62 €/MWh increase). However, a way to make the project viable through financial support is presented and an alternative to reduce the levelised cost of energy by commercialising the products of electrolysis, hydrogen and oxygen, is proposed. Finally, it is expected that with further research and development of H2 technologies, economic and energetic results will get more advantageous, opening up new perspectives for the future. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

After detailing the volatility of wind speed, irradiance and load, this paper proposes a bi-level optimization model to analyze the economic operation of the wind-photovoltaic-hydrogen hybrid system (WPH-HS). First, the relationship between the source-load output matching and operating conditions of HESS is studied, two evaluation indicators are described, which can be adjusted by wind-solar complementarity on the source side and demand response on the load side. Second, considering the levelized cost of storage (LCOS), the total annual cost (TAC) calculation method of WPH-HS is presented, and this paper provides a new hybrid optimization technology of chaotic search, particle swarm optimization and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm2. Finally, the system is simulated with the MATLAB software to determine the optimal sizing of components and minimize the LCOS while ensuring the optimal TAC. The simulation results are elaborated in detail. In particular, the added source-load interaction reduces the TAC and LCOS by 7.3% and 10.3%. When two indicators reach 0.03 and 0.1745, the system is economically viable with the LCOS of 0.276 USD/kWh.

	abstract = {In order to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and improve energy efficiency, sustainable energy systems such as multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) with the high penetration of renewable energy resources (RES) and satisfying different energy needs of consumers have received significant attention in recent years. MEMGs, by relying on renewable resources and energy storage systems along with energy conversion systems, play an essential role in sustainability of energy supply. However, renewable energies are uncertain due to the intermittent nature of solar and wind energy sources. Thus, optimal operation of the MEMGs with the consideration of the uncertainties of RES is necessary to achieve sustainability. In this paper, risk constrained scheduling of a MEMG is carried out with the presence of the PV, wind, biomass, electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen vehicles (HVs) charging stations, combined heat and power (CHP), boiler, hydrogen electrolyzer (HE), cryptocurrency miners (CMs), electrical, thermal and hydrogen storage systems, responsive demands. From the trading and business model side, the proposed MEMG optimized operation relies on bilateral contracts between producers and consumers and pool electricity markets. A two-stage stochastic programming method is used for considering the uncertainties of electrical, thermal and hydrogen demands, EV and HV charging stations load, CM load, PV and wind power, and the price of electricity purchased from the pool market. The proposed mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is solved using the CPLEX solver in GAMS which guarantees to achieve a globally optimal solution. The results show that due to the certain prices of bilateral contracts, the possibility of transaction by bilateral contracts decreases the risk metric CVaR by 50.42%. The simulation results demonstrate that risk of high operation costs while considering flexibility sources, such as storages and demand response (DR) programs, is decreased by 5.45% and 4.6%, respectively. As far as operation costs are concerned, results reveal that using renewable resources decreases operation costs by 34.47%. Moreover, the operation cost is reduced by 5.94% and 4.57% in the presence of storage units and DR programs, respectively. In the same way, storages and DR programs decrease cost of purchased electricity by 13.47% and 14.46%, respectively. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The approach was to use MATLAB to model a combined membrane distillation unit and heat exchanger that was thermally integrated with a water electrolysis stack. The model predicted that for electrolysis current densities up to 0.37A/cm2 the MDHX-EC system was able to regulate the temperature of an AEM electrolyser with 10 cells with an active area of 144 mm2 to a maximum temperature of 60 °C. Additionally, the model could be used to appropriately size the electrolyser and MDHX unit for given design requirements such as current density or maximum temperature. The model also demonstrated that for the same AEM electrolyser operated at a current density of at least 0.3 A/cm2 the MDHX unit could produce fresh water at the same rate as the electrolyser consumed fresh water. These results indicated that the thermal integration of a MDHX unit with a water electrolyser has the potential to provide performance and economic benefits and should be further studied experimentally. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen allows coupling renewable electricity to hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as long-distance transport and carbon-intensive industries, in order to achieve net zero emissions. Evaluating the cost and value of power-to-gas is a major challenge, owing to the spatial distribution and temporal variability of renewable electricity, CO2 and energy demand. Here, we propose a method, based on geographic information system (GIS) and techno-economic modeling, to: (i) compare the levelized cost and levelized value of power-to-gas across locations; (ii) identify potential hotspots for their future implementation in Switzerland; and (iii) set cost improvement targets as well as smart deployment strategies. Our method accounts for the spatial and temporal (both hourly and seasonal) availability of renewable electricity and CO2 sources, as well as the presence of gas infrastructure, heating networks, oxygen and gas demand centers. We find that only green hydrogen plants connected directly to run-of-river hydropower plants are currently profitable in Switzerland (with NPV per CAPEX ranging between 2.3-5.6). However, considering technological progress by 2050, a few green hydrogen plants deployed in the demand centers and powered by rooftop PV electricity will also become economically attractive. Moreover, a few synthetic methane plants connected to run-of-river hydropower plants currently show slight profitability (NPV per CAPEX reaching values up to 1.3) and in 2050 (NPV per CAPEX up to 3.1), whereas those connected to rooftop PV will remain uneconomical even in 2050. Based on our findings, we devise a long-term roadmap for policy makers and project developers to plan future green hydrogen projects. The proposed methodology, which is applied to Switzerland, can be extended to other countries. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Interest in low emissions hydrogen as an energy vector to assist in deep decarbonization goals has gained momentum recently. In this paper, we explore local hydrogen production from natural gas with CO2 capture and sequestration (known as “blue” H2) to support Singapore's intended inclusion of low-carbon intensity H2 fuel as a way to achieve significant CO2 emission reduction through 2050. A superstructure-based model is used to minimize the total cost or emissions of the entire supply chain, from H2 production to consumption in the power, industry, domestic, marine, and road transport sectors. H2 demand for each sector is projected for three H2 penetration scenarios (low, medium, and high). The results are analyzed for the levelized cost of H2, reduction in carbon emissions, and cost of carbon avoidance. Costs associated with direct and indirect CO2 emissions, as well as H2 and CO2 infrastructure costs, are included in total costs. A comparison of blue H2 and direct natural gas utilization with post-combustion CO2 capture and sequestration is also presented. We find that decarbonizing Singapore via local production of blue H2 will involve a relatively high carbon avoidance cost. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The study was organized in five steps. First, regarding the wind density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these locations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, it must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pump/compression stations required to transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia production in Iran, which is ready to be exported, considering all related processes involved in the hydrogen supply chain. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Offshore wind is currently the most rapidly growing renewable energy source on a global scale. The increasing deployment and high economic potential of offshore wind have prompted considerable interest in its use for hydrogen production. In this context, this study develops a Monte Carlo-based framework for assessing the competitiveness of offshore wind-to-hydrogen production. The framework is designed to evaluate the location-based variability of the levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) and explore the uncertainty that exists in the long-term planning of hydrogen production installations. The case study of Poland is presented to demonstrate the application of the framework. This work provides a detailed analysis of the LCOH considering the geographical coordinates of 23 planned offshore wind farms in the Baltic Sea. Moreover, it presents a comparative analysis of hydrogen production costs from offshore and onshore wind parks in 2030 and 2050. The results show that hydrogen from offshore wind could range between €3.60 to €3.71/kg H2 in 2030, whereas in 2050, it may range from €2.05 to €2.15/kg H2. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Integration of renewable energy sources as one of the pillars of the power system decarbonization efforts is making a significant progress. However, large shares of renewables require additional flexibility to keep the system stable. Battery storage was identified as one of the solutions to restore the grid balance in short timeframes, from day-ahead to real time. Currently, the research community is trying to find an adequate technology for longer duration energy storage. Hydrogen, as an energy carrier, appears as a good choice for such task. Apart from hydrogen energy storage potential, it can also be used to implement power-to-gas technology able to mitigate renewable energy curtailment through the process of electrolysis. The produced hydrogen gas can be either used to partially decarbonize the natural gas grids or simply sold as hydrogen fuel. The main novelty of this paper is the creation of a mathematical model of a renewable power plant coupled with a battery storage and a hydrogen facility for trading in three day-ahead energy markets, i.e. electricity, natural gas and hydrogen, plus in the power balancing market subject to the imbalance settlement mechanism. This approach enables a long-term profitability analysis of different renewable, battery and hydrogen architectures (hydrogen energy storage, power-to-gas and their combination) and their participation in different markets. The results indicate that the battery energy storage provides balancing services to the transmission system operator almost exclusively, while it never provides balancing for its own imbalance needs, since this option is less financially attractive. The electrolyzer and the fuel cell operate at least one third of the year, depending on the observed case, and often provide a reserve. When considering the hydrogen market, the electrolyzer operates almost the entire year due to lucrative hydrogen prices. Both the battery storage and the hydrogen tank perform arbitrage in the day-ahead market, where the battery optimizes its operation on an hourly basis (short-term) and the hydrogen tank on a daily basis (medium- to long-term). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Energy storage is essential to address the intermittent issues of renewable energy systems, thereby enhancing system stability and reliability. This paper presents the design and operation optimisation of hydrogen/battery/hybrid energy storage systems considering component degradation and energy cost volatility. The study examines a real-world case study, which is a grid-connected warehouse located in a tropical climate zone with a photovoltaic solar system. An accurate and robust Multi-Objective Modified Firefly Algorithm (MOMFA) is proposed for the optimal design and operation of the energy storage systems of the case study. To further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of the optimisation method, another synthetic case is tested for a location in a temperate climate zone that has a high seasonal mismatch. The modelling results show that the system in the tropical zone always provides a superior return when compared to a similar system in the temperate zone due to abundant solar resources. When comparing battery-only and hydrogen-only systems, battery systems perform better than hydrogen systems in many situations, with a higher self-sufficient ratio and net present value. However, if there is high seasonal variation and a high requirement for using renewable energy (the penetration of renewable energy is >80 %), using hydrogen for energy storage is more beneficial. Furthermore, the hybrid system (i.e., combining battery and hydrogen) outperforms battery-only and hydrogen-only systems. This is attributed to the complementary combination of hydrogen, which can be used as a long-term energy storage option, and battery, which is utilised as a short-term option. This study also shows that storing hydrogen in a long-term strategy can lower component degradation, enhance efficiency, and increase the total economic performance of hydrogen and hybrid storage systems. The developed optimisation method and findings of this study can support the implementation of energy storage systems for renewable energy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent decades, the consequences of climate changes due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have become ever more impactful, forcing international authorities to find green solutions for sustainable economic development. In this regard, one of the global targets is the reduction of fossil fuels utilization in the transport sector to encourage the diffusion of more environmentally friendly alternatives. Among them, hydrogen is emerging as a viable candidate since it is a potentially emission-free fuel when produced by exploiting renewable energy sources (RES). Nevertheless, to allow widespread use of this gas in the transport sector, several technoeconomic barriers, including production cost, and lack of distribution and storage infrastructure, have to be overcome. Distributed hydrogen production via renewable energy-powered electrolysis could be an effective solution to reduce cost and lead to economies of scale. In this study a multi-hub configuration with on-site production from PV-powered electrolysis and centralized production from steam methane reforming (SMR) is proposed. In particular, an infrastructure network for a bus refueling station located in Lazio is considered as a case study. First, each hub, composed of PV panels, an electrolyzer, a compression system, high-pressure and low-pressure storages, and hydrogen dispensers with chiller, is modeled in a Matlab/Simulink environment. Then, a design perturbation analysis is carried out to determine the impact of the configuration on the refueling station performance in terms of carbon emissions levels and the Levelized Cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The results show a significant influence of the station size on the economic performance highlighting significant benefits (reduction up to 40% in the LCOH) for a 80 bus HUB with a saturating trend towards larger sizes. CO2 emissions per unit mass of hydrogen are kept limited for all the stations thanks to the synergistic effects of SMR and Electrolyzer. Interconnecting more than one station each other further benefits can be achieved from the environmental perspective (savings up to 5 tons of CO2 are demonstrated for a typical summer case study). © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {As a carbon-free molecule, ammonia has gained great global interest in being considered a significant future candidate for the transition toward renewable energy. Numerous applications of ammonia as a fuel have been developed for energy generation, heavy transportation, and clean, distributed energy storage. There is a clear global target to achieve a sustainable economy and carbon neutrality. Therefore, most of the research's efforts are concentrated on generating cost-effective renewable energy on a large scale rather than fossil fuels. However, storage and transportation are still roadblocks for these technologies, for example, hydrogen technologies. Ammonia could be replaced as a viable fuel for a clean and sustainable future of global energy. More efforts from governments and scientists can lead to making ammonia a clean energy vector in most energy applications. In this review, ammonia synthesis was assessed, including conventional Haber–Bosch technology. Current hydrogen technologies as the key parameters for ammonia generation are also evaluated. The role of ammonia as a hydrogen-based fuel and generation roadmap are discussed for future utilization of energy mix. Further, ammonia generation processes are addressed in depth, including blue and green ammonia generation. A survey of ammonia synthesis catalytic materials was conducted and the role of catalyst materials in ammonia generation was compared, which showed that the Ru-based catalyst generated the maximum ammonia after 20 h of starting experiment. An end-use plan for using ammonia as a clean energy fuel in vehicles, marines, gas turbines as well as fuel cells, is briefly discussed to recognize the potential applications of ammonia use. The practical and future end-use vision of energy sources is proposed to achieve great benefits at low carbon emissions and costs. This review can provide prospective knowledge of large-scale aspects and environmental considerations of ammonia. Herein, we conclude that ammonia will become the “clean energy carrier link” that will achieve the global energy and economy sustainability targets. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), continue to rise yearly, mainly driven by increases in fuel and industrial emissions. Africa has a lot of sustainable energy resources to help satisfy the continent's electricity needs, which is crucial for economic growth and achieving world CO2 reduction goals. There are many promising energy technologies, but green hydrogen stands out as a frontrunner. Green hydrogen capacity was assessed in this paper as a potentially new medium for storing Egypt's renewable electrical energy and fuel. Egypt represented nations with similar renewable energy resources and climates. The lowest net present value (NPV), levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), carbon emissions, and cost of energy (COE) were achieved by implementing five different configurations in three different sites. Using solar panels, an electrolyzer, a hydrogen fuel cell, and a hydrogen storage tank, the initial configuration (A) was carried out in Benban-Aswan. The second configuration (B), in Ras Ghareb, used the identical parts as the first but substituted wind turbines for solar panels to generate electricity. Wind and solar energy were combined in a third configuration (C) tested in Edko. In Ras Ghareb, but this time with a diesel engine and the wind turbine, the fourth configuration (D) was implemented. Excluding the hydrogen fuel cell from the prior setup, the final configuration (E) was identical. The HOMER software measured the GHG emissions from diesel generators and renewable energy sources. A sensitivity analysis of the operating reserve amount and discount rate variance was performed. According to the findings, the second configuration (B) carried out in Ras Ghareb had the lowest NPV at 1.81 M $, the lowest COE at 0.3085 $/kWh, and the lowest LCOH at 3.94 $/kg. Regarding greenhouse gas emissions, Configuration (D) produced 7,664 kg/year of CO2. Configuration (E) has a CO2 output of 87,021 kg/year. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study was planned to offer the roadmap for lifecycle clean shipping by addressing the fundamental question of ‘what are the promising energy solutions for the shipping sector?’. This goal was attempted to be achieved by a lifecycle comparative analysis of the viability of three zero-carbon fuels, ammonia, hydrogen, and inland electricity, based on the operational practicality as well as Well-to-Wake environmental impacts. Credible business scenarios were designed with a high-level screening of 27 short-route ferries currently engaged in 26 West-Scotland coastal routes. Then a series of comparative analyses between the diesel and the proposed alternative fuel sources was conducted. While carbon-free fuels are in the early stages of development in the UK, there are various views on how these fuels can be produced, distributed, and used onboard for the clean shipping economy. To determine the optimal energy solutions, all credible scenarios for the upstream pathways for these fuels were developed, based on the current and future prospected UK energy infrastructure and grids. Those scenarios were examined for West-Scotland shipping and extended to the UK targets. Their technical aspects for maritime application were also investigated in consideration of safety, regulation, infrastructural availability, supply chain constraints, barriers, and the downstream emission pathways to their uptake onboard. Ship conceptual designs were briefly conducted to evaluate the systems, technologies, and equipment required for onboard installation to utilise zero-carbon fuels. As a result of the study, when hydrogen was used as a fuel in fuel cells and electricity was supplied as a backup from batteries that store inland power and the solar PV system, GHG emissions were 25.7% of the conventional fossil fuel-using scenario. In addition, it was confirmed that GWP was 22.2% compared to MGO when ammonia was used as fuel without reforming into hydrogen and backup power was supplied from batteries and the solar PV system. It is believed that the analysis results can distinctively demonstrate the adequacy or the inadequacy of current maritime policies for decarbonising shipping. This research finally provides potential solutions for future UK maritime environmental protection and for enhancing the competitiveness of ship owners. In addition, this research concept can serve as a sample that suggests the direction of ideal research for future energy solutions in the marine sector. © 2022},

	abstract = {Biohydrogen is perceived as the versatile fuel of the future, having the ability to replace fossil fuels in many industrial and commercial sectors and offering the promise of fulfilling future renewable energy demands. Among various options available for the generation of biohydrogen, photofermentation with the help of microbes and algae is one of the most eye-catching approaches due to its relative efficiency, cost economics, and reduced environmental impacts. Generation of biohydrogen by dark fermentation, microbial electrolysis cell as well as photofermentation, along with their bioprocesses, already have been discussed in earlier literature. Photofermentation offers advantages of both biophotolysis (utilization of light energy) and dark fermentation (utilization of organic waste materials as substrate). Many researchers have been reported successful biohydrogen production from photofermentation-based techniques, however not much information is available regarding the considerable gap in industrial and economic challenges in the production of biohydrogen at the commercial level through photofermentation. Efforts have been made in this review to provide updated information on various new technologies being used in this sector, such as the integration of photofermentation with dark fermentation, the use of recombinant DNA technology, and the use of bionanotechnology to improve biohydrogen production through the utilization of various waste. Various challenges in this sector, as well as future perspectives, have been meticulously addressed in order to explore the future of green biohydrogen production for a sustainable future. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {One of the trends in the development of the electric power industry in the world is the use of renewable resources. In recent years, the development of hydrogen energy has been widely discussed, which, when combined with renewable energy sources, makes it possible to obtain “green” hydrogen. One of the promising solutions for obtaining green hydrogen is the development of wind energy-hydrogen systems. However, one of the limiting factors, in addition to economic aspects, are technical limitations. Sustainable hydrogen production is complicated by the variability of wind energy. In addition, energy systems with a predominant share of wind power units have a low total inertia value. Consequently, such systems become more sensitive to changes in load modes in the grid and become less stable in emergency modes. Together, these facts reduce the reliability of wind energy-hydrogen system. The paper proposes to increase the stability of wind energy-hydrogen system and power system as a whole to apply synthetic inertia for wind power plants. It is shown that by adjusting the parameters of synthetic inertia can provide not only the required inertial response, but also increase the dynamic stability of the power system and as a consequence wind energy-hydrogen system. The influence of the measurement window time and calculation of the frequency change rate, which is important in certain modes, is also investigated. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The need for a rapid transformation to low-carbon economies has rekindled hydrogen as a promising energy carrier. Yet, the full range of environmental consequences of large-scale hydrogen production remains unclear. Here, prospective life cycle analysis is used to compare different options to produce 500 Mt/yr of hydrogen, including scenarios that consider likely changes to future supply chains. The resulting environmental and human health impacts of such production levels are further put into context with the Planetary Boundaries framework, known human health burdens, the impacts of the world economy, and the externality-priced production costs that embody the environmental impact. The results indicate that climate change impacts of projected production levels are 3.3–5.4 times higher than the allocated planetary boundary, with only green hydrogen from wind energy staying below the boundary. Human health impacts and other environmental impacts are less severe in comparison but metal depletion and ecotoxicity impacts of green hydrogen deserve further attention. Priced-in environmental damages increase the cost most strongly for blue hydrogen (from ∼2 to ∼5 USD/kg hydrogen), while such true costs drop most strongly for green hydrogen from solar photovoltaic (from ∼7 to ∼3 USD/kg hydrogen) when applying prospective life cycle analysis. This perspective helps to evaluate potentially unintended consequences and contributes to the debate about blue and green hydrogen. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Transitioning to 100% renewable energy to mitigate climate change requires solutions for hard-to-abate energy sectors. It must also be complemented with negative emissions technologies to ensure climate security. Previous studies have investigated the feasibility of e-fuels and e-chemicals production for export and some carbon dioxide removal technologies in several regions. This study investigates, for the first time, the techno-economic impacts of offering such services on an exporting country's energy system as it transitions to 100% renewable energy by 2050. Egypt is used as a representative case study for sunbelt countries with adequate land area. Four scenarios with different system configurations have been investigated using the LUT Energy System Transition Model and compared to a reference 100% domestic renewable energy system. The results show that Egypt can technically provide 5% of the required global carbon dioxide removal capacity starting from 2035, and 10% of Europe's demand for e-fuels and e-chemicals starting from 2025 within land use constraints. The provision of both services enhances the domestic energy system performance by reducing the levelised costs of important feedstocks, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, as well as other domestic cost metrics and system losses. These findings are extendable and relevant to similar sunbelt countries. They are also relevant to European countries looking to fulfil their climate targets while diversify their energy imports sources. Overall, this study is an important step in 100% renewable energy transition research and international climate change mitigation efforts. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The engineers are very interested in concentrated solar power (CSP) due to its renewable energy source nature. However, for this technology to grow, it is crucial to integrate efficient, cost-effective subsystems. On the other hand, since liquid metal magnetohydrodynamic (LMMHD) power generation systems can operate at high temperatures of 600 °C–3000 °C, they are ideal for use as a subsystem of a CSP-based plant to improve efficiency. The use of waste heat recovery units is another method of increasing efficiency and preventing exergy losses. Taking these points into consideration, the proposed trigeneration system includes an LMMHD, a CSP, and humidification-dehumidification and proton exchange membrane units to produce power, freshwater, as well as hydrogen, respectively. Performance evaluation of the presented system includes thermodynamic and thermoeconomic considerations. The results show that the presented system produces 11.87 kW of power, 6.1 m3/h of hydrogen, and 860.2 L/h of freshwater with an energy utilization factor of 45.81%, a total exergy efficiency of 4.63%, and a unit cost of 19.57 $/kWh. The receiver is the most destructive component of the system, with 256.9 kW of exergy destruction. Further, the parametric study indicates that it is possible to maximize the energy efficiency of the system by changing the concentration ratio of the receiver. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) can provide power without emission for off-grid areas. Due to intermittency of renewable energy, energy storage system (ESS) is essential for reliable power supply, while its cost is still relatively high. Appropriate power management strategy (PMS) can help to delay the degradation of energy storage devices and reduce the system cost. In this study, power management strategy and configuration optimization of the system are focused and the study includes three main contributions. First, mathematical models of the system, including photovoltaics (PVs), wind turbines (WTs), batteries, fuel cells (FCs), electrolyzers (ELZs), and hydrogen tanks are developed. The degradation of fuel cells and electrolyzers is considered in the modeling process. Second, power management strategy considering hysteresis band is employed to control energy flow to delay fuel cell and electrolyzer degradation. Third, a multi-objective optimization function including the system net annual value (NAV), loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and excess energy (Eexcess) is established. Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to solve objective function. The results demonstrate that using hysteresis band help improve the system performance and reduce the cost. In addition, by setting the goal of excess energy, system reliability is well preserved with a LPSP as low as 0.92%. Compared with other optimization algorithms such as MOEA/D, NSGA-II has a smaller SI value of 422.10 and a larger DI value of 830.78, therefore the Pareto solution obtained by NSGA-II has a more uniform distribution and larger coverage. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy is a key role in novel renewable energy production/consumption technologies. Traditional hydrogen energy systems are suffered from low density, high production cost, low efficiency, and storage complications. With the start of solid-state hydrogen storage technology, many of above deficiencies are fulfilled, however, there are several unknown points, particularly in metal oxides, which need more attention. Hydrogen sorption on the layered materials or inside porous materials is a hopeful key to drawbacks for high-performance hydrogen sorption. Hereupon, layered solids with the merit of hydrogen sorption are introduced, for the first time, including “nanostructured bi-metal oxide (BMO)” and “graphitic carbon nitride (CN)”. Perovskites are ceramic and they are hard materials so they could be a favorable candidate for solid-state hydrogen storage. g-C3N4 has attractive features including high surface area, chemical stability, small band gap, and low-cost synthesis methods but also has great potential as an electrode material for energy storage capacitors. The main motivation for this study comes from the potential applications for perovskite materials and graphitic carbon nitride for the solid-state hydrogen storage method. The Perovskite type GdFeO3 nanostructures (as BMO) synthesized through sol-gel approach in front of natural source of Grape juice as both complexing agent and fuel. The experimental scrutinization ascertains an original fabrication of GdFeO3 (GF) nanostructures in Grape juice at 800 °C, with an approximately uniform nanosized structure of 70 nm on average. The obtained pure GF nanostructures are then utilized for nanocomposite formation based on g-C3N4 (CN) with different amounts. The resulting nanocomposites with the ratio of 1:2 from GF:CN perform a preferable hydrogen sorption capacity, in terms of “maximum discharge capacity of 577 mAhg−1” in 2 M KOH electrolyte. It should be declared that however, the discharge capacity of the nanostructured GF is 188 mAhg−1. It can be emphasized that these GF/CN nanocomposites can be utilized as hopeful hosts in an electrochemical hydrogen storage setup due to the synergic effect of g-C3N4 with essential characteristics in cooperation with BMO nanostructures as acceptable electrocatalysts. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The base case of a renewable energy source of 100 MW capacity coupled with a 20 MW hydrogen production system and 20 MW transmission to the grid shows an LCOH of 5.9 USD/kg with a capacity factor of 25%. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to examine the impact of electrolyser size and the composition of renewable energy source on its capacity factor and economic feasibility. The results demonstrate that the capacity factor of an electrolysis system is not directly proportional to the renewable energy capacity but depends on the its designed capacity as well as the climate pattern and the mix ratio between solar and wind energy. Though the effect of the electrolyser's operating range is found insignificant in a part-load operation but not in an overload operation. In addition, the effects of the capital cost, system efficiency, and electricity price on LCOH are assessed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Integrating renewable energy resources (RES) is a challenge for power system operators due to their fluctuations and unpredictability. At the same time, the water shortage problem and the needs to desalinate more freshwater increase the prominence of sufficient energy resources for sustainable operation. Therefore, this paper presents a market-clearing mechanism in a co-optimization model that coordinates the operation of grid-connected reverse osmosis water desalination plants (RO-WDPs) and the operation of renewable-rich power systems. It is assumed that electric demands can participate in the provision of demand response (DR) to the market via multiple DR options. The DR options related to the general loads are demand shifting, load curtailment, distributed generation, and hybrid energy storage systems (HESS). These HESS includes battery storage and hydrogen storage systems. Pertaining to their special characteristics, a new DR option is proposed as a customized option for RO-WDPs. The market clearing mechanism is assumed to be based on the security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) to optimally schedule the day-ahead operation of the power system. The presented model is applied on 6-bus and IEEE 24-bus reliability test system (RTS) test power systems with significant penetration of RES to demonstrate its merits. The simulation results show that the system efficiency is enhanced by adding the energy flexibility of RO-WDP without endangering the water demand-supply when using the proposed coordinated model. Hence, the total operation cost is minimized, the RES integration is facilitated, and the hourly electricity prices are smoothened. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Existing research offers insights into production, operation, and cost efficiencies for the expanding variety of hydrogen (H2) technologies, suggesting that not a single one, but a portfolio of technologies, may be competitive in emerging markets. In turn, policy studies point out that economic and market conditions may be altered to promote certain options, for instance, renewable energy-based “green” hydrogen over fossil fuel-based alternatives. Such regionally oriented analyses, however useful, do not provide a perspective on a global market or international trade development, which is critical for infrastructure development, demand expansion, and supply commitments. This paper aims to fill this gap by addressing two interrelated questions: 1) what are the prerequisites for hydrogen trade in the context of a global transition to carbon neutrality and 2) how will regional energy system characteristics and regulations affect the growth and the “color” of the hydrogen market? Focused on green H2, we start our analysis with the evaluation of renewable energy generation potential of individual countries to identify geographic and economic factors and constraints for regional H2 development. Revealing resource-rich countries with green H2 export potential and resource-poor regions, likely green H2 importers, we turn to energy price data showing why green H2 is likely to face competition from other H2 colors. We capture those insights with an international hydrogen trade model, focusing on H2 supply diversity and factors determining local demand, including prices for renewable energy versus fossil fuels, emission constraints, and cost associated with carbon utilization and or disposal. Incorporating supply and demand drivers within a common framework enables us to embrace the complexity and to understand the discrepancies in existing H2 trade projections. We use the model to explore the role of carbon regulations, rate of renewable energy adoption, transportation costs, and input energy prices in the future H2 market evolution. To gain further insights into the future trade dynamics, we perform simulations mimicking the emerging German market. Hence, our work provides a unique comprehensive energy system perspective at the global scale, supported by analytical and empirical data analyses. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The economic analysis of the entire process from hydrogen production to transportation was conducted in this study, and the advantages of high-pressure PEM electrolysis were proved. The economic analysis has also illustrated the influence of the cathode pressure and membrane thickness involved in PEM electrolysis on the energy consumption and capital expenditure of the electrolyzer from the perspectives of hydrogen permeability, ohmic impedance, and structural design. Although the output pressure of hydrogen is increased several tens of times, the proper structure and unchanged thickness of the membrane can help satisfy the strength and safety requirements of the electrolyzer simultaneously. In addition, the energy consumption and cost increase associated with the high-pressure electrolyzer can be limited to an acceptable range. The impact of the renewable energy scale on the decision and selection for PEM or ALK is also analyzed; PEM has an advantage over ALK in large-scale renewable energy hydrogen production scenarios because of its own wider upper and lower load limits compared to those of ALK. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Multi-energy complementary distributed energy system integrated with renewable energy is at the forefront of energy sustainable development and is an important way to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction. A comparative analysis of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-micro gas turbine (MGT)-combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) systems coupled with two solar methane steam reforming processes is presented in terms of energy, exergy, environmental and economic performances in this paper. The first is to couple with the traditional solar methane steam reforming process. Then the produced hydrogen-rich syngas is directly sent into the SOFC anode to produce electricity. The second is to couple with the medium-temperature solar methane membrane separation and reforming process. The produced pure hydrogen enters the SOFC anode to generate electricity, and the remaining small amount of fuel gas enters the afterburner to increase the exhaust gas enthalpy. Both systems transfer the low-grade solar energy to high-grade hydrogen, and then orderly release energy in the systems. The research results show that the solar thermochemical efficiency, energy efficiency and exergy efficiency of the second system reach 52.20%, 77.97% and 57.29%, respectively, 19.05%, 7.51% and 3.63% higher than those of the first system, respectively. Exergy analysis results indicate that both the solar heat collection process and the SOFC electrochemical process have larger exergy destruction. The levelized cost of products of the first system is about 0.0735$/h that is lower than that of the second system. And these two new systems have less environmental impact, with specific CO2 emissions of 236.98 g/kWh and 249.89 g/kWh, respectively. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The use of reversible solid oxide cells within a renewable energy community results a promising application which permits to balance the temporal mismatch between renewable energy production and users’ demand through hydrogen as energy vector. Differently from batteries and supercapacitors, this technology is characterized by a high stored energy density and a negligible daily self-discharge. Nevertheless, the system management is more complex requiring cell behaviour optimization and hydrogen storage control. Here this work proposes a control algorithm for reversible solid oxide cell operation coupled to renewable energy sources within a renewable energy community formed by an aggregation of fifteen residential customers. Based on forecasts of loads and renewable energy production, the proposed algorithm, a stochastic model predictive control, can optimize system operation aiming at economic benefit maximization. The transition between the fuel cell mode for power generation and the electrolysis mode for energy storage through hydrogen production was set considering the available renewable energy, the power demand of community members and the energy sell-back price in order to increase the auto-consumed amount as well as to favour the electricity exchange within the renewable energy community. Since the reversible solid oxide cell is the key-point in such a system, SIMFC-SIMEC (SIMulation of Fuel Cells and Electrolysis Cells), a physically based 2D model, allowed an effective prediction of cell behaviour deriving the efficiency of electricity and hydrogen production from local physicochemical feature and working parameter gradients on each stacked cell plane. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The transportation sector, which is largely dependent on oil, is faced with many problems such as the danger of depletion of fossil fuels that are harmful to the environment. Moreover, the situations such as epidemics and war cause excessive fluctuations in oil prices. Therefore, there is a need for new solutions based on alternative energy sources for a sustainable transportation sector. Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEV) are one of the significant alternatives for an efficient, zero emissions and sustainable transportation system. Considering the potential investment in HFCEV technology, the need for a cost effective, green, and low risk Hydrogen Supply Chain (HSC) network infrastructure is inevitable. In this study, the HSC design of the Turkish transportation sector over a 25-year period (2026–2050) is investigated. The problem is modeled using a multi-period mixed integer linear programming (MIP) model. Three objectives are addresses: cost, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and safety risk. In order to consider the uncertainty in the hydrogen demand, five different scenarios are analyzed using fuzzy concept. There are four main results. First, unit hydrogen cost is found to be very high due to low demand and high capital cost in the initial period (2026–2031). Second, HSC network is established in a decentralized setting in all scenario solutions. The level of decentralization gets stronger over time and with increasing demand. Third, short-distance road transport is generally preferred for hydrogen transport. Fourth, since the aim is to minimize cost, CO2 emissions, and risk level, a mixed production strategy based on cost-oriented SMR and zero-emissions-oriented Electrolysis (ELE) is observed in all scenarios. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Recently, many efforts have been done to overcome increasing fuel consumption. One of the vital solutions is utilization of standalone renewable energy resources hybrid systems. This paper attempts to develop a cost-effective methodology to ascertain optimal design and energy management for a remote village. Different energy resources such as wind and solar, fuel cell, and energy storage systems are employed to satisfy total demands including agriculture, residential, school, and health center. Different hydrogen production methods are proposed to verify the efficiency of the developed methodology. In the proposed village, different waste types such as rice husk, maize straw, livestock, and residential wastes are used to generate the required hydrogen for fuel cells to generate electricity. The main objective of the proposed methodology is minimizing the total cost of the village including total costs of each Distributed Generation (DG), cost of natural gas consumption, penalty for interruption the demands, and cost of CO2 emission. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to solve the optimization problem by minimizing the total system costs while the customers required Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) is satisfied. The suggested hybrid system not only increases the renewable energy penetration but also decreases the natural gas consumption. The results achieved in the course of the present study depict that utilization of energy produced from different types of wastes plays a significant role in conserving fossil fuels and overcoming the fossil fuels depletion. It is concluded from the results that there is about a 17.46% reduction in natural gas consumption when all available waste is utilized. In addition, considering 100% availability for the animal manure reduces the natural gas consumption by reformer from 2.373 to 1.605 million liters which means reduction of the natural gas consumption is 32.35%. The results conclude that H2 produced by livestock waste is dominating among available wastes. However, there is about 18% reduction in the Cost of Energy (COE), when 100% availability is considered for this type of waste. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The microgrid includes zero-emission vehicles, renewable energy sources, an electrolyzer, bidirectional charging stations, and a hydrogen refueling station with hydrogen storage. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging stations can alleviate renewable electricity variability by discharging the energy of vehicle batteries back to the grid. The electrolyzer can absorb excess solar generation to balance supply and demand with power-to-gas (P2G) transactions. Given the uncertainties from intermittent renewable generation and energy demand, a two-stage stochastic optimization framework derives the optimal power management strategy for the component subsystems, aiming to minimize operating costs. The first stage of the model determines the day-ahead charging price and power supply for electric vehicle charging and hydrogen production, and the second stage performs real-time energy scheduling under different scenarios. The performance of the proposed optimization strategy is examined through a case study using real-world data, and the results demonstrate that daily operating costs can be reduced by up to 27.5%. Moreover, inclusion of the P2G process with hydrogen storage yields better performance to support peak shaving and reducing costs compared to using V2G or dynamic pricing-based demand response policies only. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The optimal dispatch of the integrated power and natural gas systems can increase the utilization rate of renewable energy and energy efficiency while decreasing operation costs. The common prediction errors of wind power and electric load have the potential to negatively impact the normal operation of the integrated power and natural gas systems. A two-stage data-driven dispatch strategy is proposed to reduce this effect, consisting of the day-ahead dispatch stage and the intraday rolling dispatch stage using stochastic model predictive control (MPC). In the day-ahead dispatch stage, the data-driven chance constraints of tie-line power and reserve of gas-fired generators are built, and the day-ahead tie-line power is obtained and regarded as input parameters to the intraday dispatch stage. In the intraday dispatch stage, the data-driven chance constraints of tie-line power and reserve of gas-fired generators with the latest rolling prediction data are built, and the remaining control variables are obtained. The distribution characteristics of the stochastic prediction errors of wind power and electric load are captured and described by the variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model with massive historical data. Then the original stochastic mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem is converted to a tractable deterministic one by the quantile-based analytical reformulation and convex relaxation technique. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified by the numerical experiments based on a modified IEEE 33-bus system integrated with a 10-node natural gas system and a micro hydrogen system. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy reduces the actual costs and decreases the violation rate caused by the stochastic prediction errors of wind power and electric load. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Clean energy resources will be used more for sustainability improvement and durable development. Efficient technologies of energy production, storage, and usage results in reduction of gas emissions and improvement of the world economy. Despite 30% of electricity being produced from wind energy, the connection of wind farms to medium and large-scale grid power systems is still leading to instability and intermittency problems. Therefore, the conversion of electrical energy generated from wind parks into green hydrogen consists of an exciting solution for advancing the development of green hydrogen production, and the clean transportation sector. This paper presents a techno-economic optimization of hydrogen production for refueling fuel cell vehicles, using wind energy resources. The paper analyses three configurations, standalone Wind-Park Hydrogen Refueling Station (WP-HRS) with backup batteries, WP-HRS with backup fuel cells, and grid-connected WP-HRS. The analysis of different configurations is based on the wind potential at the site, costs of different equipment, and hydrogen load. Therefore, the study aims to find the optimized capacity of wind turbines, electrolyzers, power converters, and storage tanks. The optimization results show that the WP-HRS connected to the grid has the lowest Present Worth Cost (PWC) of 6,500,000 €. Moreover, the Levelized Hydrogen Cost (LHC) of this solution was found to be 6.24 €/kg. This renewable energy system produces 80,000 kg of green hydrogen yearly. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The transformation from a fossil fuels economy to a low carbon economy reshapes how energy is transmitted. Since most renewable energy is harvested in the form of electricity, hydrogen obtained from water electrolysis using green electricity is considered a promising energy vector. However, the storage and transportation of hydrogen at large scales pose challenges to the existing energy infrastructures, both regarding technological and economic aspects. To facilitate the distribution of renewable energy, a set of candidate hydrogen transportation infrastructures using methanol and ammonia as hydrogen carriers were proposed. A systematical analysis reveals that the levelized costs of transporting hydrogen using methanol and ammonia in the best cases are $1879/t-H2 and $1479/t-H2, respectively. The levelized cost of energy transportation using proposed infrastructures in the best case is $10.09/GJ.

	abstract = {The expected increase of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles has motivated the emergence of a significant number of studies on Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRS). Some of the main HRS topics are sizing, location, design optimization, and optimal operation. On-site green HRS, where hydrogen is produced locally from green renewable energy sources, have received special attention due to their contribution to decarbonization. This kind of HRS are complex systems whose hydraulic and electric linked topologies include renewable energy sources, electrolyzers, buffer hydrogen tanks, compressors and batteries, among other components. This paper develops a linear model of a real on-site green HRS that is set to be built in Zaragoza, Spain. This plant can produce hydrogen either from solar energy or from the utility grid and is designed for three different types of services: light-duty and heavy-duty fuel cell vehicles and gas containers. In the literature, there is a lack of online control solutions developed for HRS, even more in the form of optimal online control. Hence, for the HRS operation, a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) is designed to solve a weighted multi-objective online optimization problem taking into account the plant dynamics and constraints as well as the disturbances prediction. Performance is analysed throughout 210 individual month-long simulations and the effect of the multi-objective weighting, prediction horizon, and hydrogen selling price is discussed. With the simulation results, this work shows the suitability of MPC for HRS control and its significant economic advantage compared to the rule-based control solution. In all simulations, the MPC operation fulfils all required services. Moreover, results show that a seven-day prediction horizon can improve profits by 57% relative to a one-day prediction horizon; that the battery is under-sized; or that the MPC operation strategy is more resolutive for low hydrogen selling prices. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Using renewable energy sources (RES) and green hydrogen has increased dramatically as one of the best solutions to global environmental issues. Applying demand response programs (DRPs) in this context could enhance the system's efficiency. Evaluating different DRPs’ performances and assessing economic impacts on different parts of the electricity market is essential. The inherent uncertainty of RES and prices is inevitable in electricity markets. As a result of the lack of information, it is crucial to mitigate the risks as much as possible, such as risks related to changes in demand, unit outages, or other traders’ bid strategies. This research introduces a robust multi-objective optimization method to reach the most confident plan for the retailer based on uncertainty in RES and price. The integration of different DRPs is assessed according to the cost to retailers and benefits for consumers using a multi-objective model to survey the impacts of different parts’ decisions on each other. The trade-off among DRPs is considered in this model, and they are traded using a new model to illustrate the daily effect of these programs in monthly operations. This paper uses hydrogen storage (HS) integrated with PV as a distributed energy resource. As the Iranian electricity market has just been established, this research proposes a framework for decision-making in new electricity markets to join future smart energy systems. The mid-term pricing evaluates the system's performance for more accurate monthly results. Also, the operation cost of the hydrogen storage is modeled to assess its performance in non-robust and robust scheduling. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been used to model this problem in GAMS. A developed linearizing method is considered with a controllable amount of errors to reduce the volume and time of the computation. Finally, the cost of consumers in non-robust and robust market planning in the presence of DRPs is reduced by 8.77 % and 9.66 %, respectively, and HS has a compelling performance in peak-shaving and load-shifting. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the transformation of energy structure, the proportion of renewable energy in the power grid continues to increase. However, the power grid's capacity to absorb renewable is limited. In view of this, converting the excess renewable energy into hydrogen and injecting it into natural gas network for transportation can not only increase the absorption capacity of renewable energy but also reduce the transportation cost of hydrogen. While this can lead to the problem that hydrogen injection will make the dynamic characteristics of the pipeline more complicated, and hydrogen embrittlement of pipeline may occur. It is of great significance to simulate the dynamic characteristics of gas pipeline with hydrogen injection, especially the hydrogen mixture ratio. In this paper, the cell segmentation method is used to solve each natural gas pipeline model, the gas components are recalculated in each cell and the parameters of partial differential equation are updated. Additionally, the dynamic simulation model of natural gas network with hydrogen injections is established. Simulation results show that for a single pipeline, when the inlet hydrogen ratio changes, whether or not hydrogen injection has little influence on the pressure and flow. The propagation speed of hydrogen concentration is far less than that of the pressure and flow rate, and it takes about 1.2 × 105 s for the 100 km pipeline hydrogen ratio to reach the steady state again. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The future-oriented peer-to-peer energy trading management strategy is proposed considering large renewable energy generation in determining time-of-use power periods to improve energy flexibility. The aleatory and epistemic uncertainties of key weather parameters determining renewables generation with climate changes are quantified and various machine learning regression models are used to predict dynamic solar photovoltaic and wind power generation by 2050 with weather uncertainty. The study results indicate that the ambient temperature increases with time at the uncertainty range of [0, 17.82%], the beam radiation and sky diffuse radiation decrease with time at [−24.86%, 0], and the ground reflected diffuse radiation and wind speed show an uncertain trend at [−0.72%, 0.72%]. The annual solar photovoltaic and wind power generation in 2050 is projected to be 11.69% and 0.61% lower than those of the typical meteorological year. The peer trading cost saving in 2050 considering climate changes is reduced by 2.25% and the annual equivalent carbon emissions are increased by 9.15% compared with the typical meteorological year scenario. The uncertainty design of net-zero energy communities integrated with hydrogen vehicle and battery vehicle storage considering climate changes provides significant guidance for advancing net zero carbon and realizing carbon neutrality for integrated building and transport sectors by 2050. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

A case study in Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, was applied with six scenarios: two reference scenarios of hydrogen production, steam reform with and without carbon capture; and the other four regarding the use of wind energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen via water electrolysis. Results showed that the technological proposal has the potential to mitigate up to 22.11% of the greenhouse gas emissions in the refinery, from both hydrogen production and Fluid Catalytic Cracking units, at abatement costs in the range of −41 to 868 US$/tCO2. The lowest value depends on a severe reduction in electrolysis costs and the expected high penetration of renewable energies on electrical systems.

The electricity demand of an office building is considered to be supplied by Photovoltaic Panels and wind turbines. The office building, modeled in Energy Plus and Open studio, has annual electricity consumption of 500 MWh electricity. 48.9% of the required electricity can be generated via renewable resources. Considering a system without energy storage, the remaining amount of electricity is generated from diesel generators. Hence, for reducing CO2 emission and fuel costs, a hydrogen energy storage system (ESS) is integrated into the system. Hydrogen ESS is responsible for supplying 38.6% of the demand electricity, which means that it can increase the energy supplying ability of the system from 48.9% to 87.5%. In addition to analyzing the application of the hydrogen storage system, the effect of four different kinds of fuel is considered as well. effects of Natural gas, Diesel, Propane, and LPG on the system's application are investigated in this study. Results indicate that natural gas emits less amount of CO2 compared to other fuels and also has a fuel cost of 3054 $/year, while hydrogen ESS is available. For the renewable system without ESS, the fuel cost rises to 10,266 $/year.

	abstract = {Spatiotemporal energy interaction and sharing are promising solutions to penetrate renewable energy, enhance grid power stability, and improve regional energy flexibility. However, the current literature is restrained in a small-scale neighborhood level, without considering inter-city energy migration through spatiotemporal complementarity between renewable-abundant regions (like suburb or countryside areas) and demand-shortage regions (like city centers). In this study, the energy interaction boundary is extended from a neighborhood scale to an inter-city scale, to maximize the renewable energy penetration, demand coverage, and reduce regional energy imbalance. This study firstly proposes a holistic framework on inter-city transportation-based energy migration, consisting of a residential community with rooftop photovoltaic systems and electrical batteries, an office building, hydrogen vehicles (HVs), a hydrogen (H2) station, and local power grids, for the energy transmission between building groups in spatially different regions through the daily commuting of HVs. Optimal grid-regulation strategies are thereafter proposed and adopted to stabilize the grid power and reduce energy costs. Parametric analysis on energy trading strategies and prices has been conducted, to improve the participation motivations of different stakeholders. Results indicate that, compared to the reference case with isolated buildings and vehicles, the transportation-based energy migration framework covers 23.2 % of the office energy demand and elevates the community's renewable self-use ratio from 72.7 % to 98.6 %. Meanwhile, the maximum grid-export power in the renewable-abundant region (suburb residential community) and the annual grid-import power in the demand-shortage region (city-center office) are reduced by up to 86.9 % (from 155.7 to 20.4 kW) and 29.4 % (from 49.0 to 34.6 kW), respectively. Moreover, even considering the fuel cell degradation cost of HVs, the transportation-based energy migration framework reduces the operating costs of the office building and HVs (the H2 cost and the fuel cell degradation cost) by 16.4 % (from $52791.3 to $44154.7) and 1.7 % (from $27172.5 to $26707.4), respectively. Afterward, compared to the reference case, the peak-shaving and load-shaping grid-regulation strategies can decrease the peak grid-export power of the community by about 71.6 % (from 155.7 to 44.2 kW), and the maximum grid-import power of the office by 23.7 % (from 49.0 to 37.4 kW), respectively. Furthermore, the transportation-based energy migration framework is economically feasible, only when the renewable export price for H2 production is 0.07 $/kWh, the onsite-renewable-generated H2 lower than 6.5 $/kg for the HV owners, and the vehicle-to-building electricity lower than 0.3 $/kWh for the office building. This study provides a novel inter-city energy migration framework with hydrogen networks to enhance district energy sharing, improve regional energy balance and reduce carbon emission, together with frontier guidelines on energy trading prices to promote participation motivations from different stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the residential area, the cost of the electricity is at the maximum level during the peak demand periods. Regarding this, the peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading strategy is a hopeful and practical solution to deal with this problem. Also, in the P2P home energy management system, the buildings have become more flexible by sharing their powers to meet their electricity demands. In this work, we have considered three buildings, in which two of them are equipped with solar panels, and in the third one, the hydrogen source is established. In the proposed residential zone, the considered buildings are connected in order to perform P2P transactions to reduce the energy billing. The operator of the system is wholly investigated under uncertain conditions based on the downside risk constraint (DRC) method in both risk-averse and risk-neutral models. With the help of a P2P energy trading strategy as well as renewable energy resources, we can provide electricity to customers in remote areas where it is not possible to supply electricity or is not economically beneficial. Based on the obtained results, the function of the proposed system has manifested in an acceptable manner. For instance, in the solar panel function in the second building, the amount of generated solar power is 30 kW in the risk-averse model, whereas, in the risk-neutral model, it is 18 kW. On the other hand, the level of consumed electricity by the electrolyzer system is generally lower in the risk-averse model than risk-neutral model in the second season. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Environment-friendly, safe and reliable energy supplies are indispensable to society for sustainable development and high life quality where even though social, environmental, political and economic challenges may play a vital role in their provision. Our continuously growing energy demand is driven by extensive growth in economic development and population and places an ever-increasing burden on fossil fuel utilization that represent a substantial percentage of this increasing energy demand but also creates challenges associated with increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and resource depletion. Such challenges make the global transition obligatory from conventional to renewable energy sources. Hydrogen is emerging as a new energy vector outside its typical role and receiving more recognition globally as a potential fuel pathway, as it offers advantages in use cases and unlike synthetic carbon-based fuels can be truly carbon neutral or even negative on a life cycle basis. This review paper provides critical analysis of the state-of-the-art in blue and green hydrogen production methods using conventional and renewable energy sources, utilization of hydrogen, storage, transportation, distribution and key challenges and opportunities in the commercial deployment of such systems. Some of the key promising renewable energy sources to produce hydrogen, such as solar and wind, are intermittent; hydrogen appears to be the best candidate to be employed for multiple purposes blending the roles of fuel energy carrier and energy storage modality. Furthermore, this study offers a comparative assessment of different non-renewable and renewable hydrogen production systems based on system design, cost, global warming potential (GWP), infrastructure and efficiency. Finally the key challenges and opportunities associated with hydrogen production, storage, transportation and distribution and commercial-scale deployment are addressed. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide emission, advances the dependency on fossil fuels and improves the economy of the energy sector, especially in developing countries. Hydrogen is required for the green transportation sector and many other industrial applications. However, the high cost of green hydrogen production reduces the fast development of renewable energy projects based on hydrogen production. So, sizing by optimization is required to determine the optimum solutions for green hydrogen production. In this context, this paper aims to analyze three methods that can be developed and implemented for the production of green hydrogen for refueling stations using photovoltaic (PV) systems. Techno-economic models are adopted to calculate the Levelized Hydrogen Cost (LHC) for the PV grid-connected system, stand-alone PV system with batteries, and stand-alone PV system with fuel cells. The photovoltaic systems based green hydrogen refueling stations are optimized using Homer software. The optimization results of the Net Profit Cost (NPC), and the LHC permit the comparison of the three cases and the selection of the optimal solution. The analysis has shown that a 3 MWp grid-connected PV system represents a promising green hydrogen production at an LHC of 5.5 €/kg. The system produces 58 615 kg of green hydrogen per year reducing carbon dioxide emission by 8209 kg per year. The LHC in the stand-alone PV system with batteries, and stand-alone PV system with fuel cells are 5.74 €/kg and 7.38 €/kg, respectively. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The structure and electronic features of isolated Fe atom anchored on three graphene surfaces with single vacancy (SV), double vacancy (DV) and Stone-Wales structure (SW) defect were systematically explored. The three structures prove to be high activity and high stability on catalytic. The adsorption and the energy barrier of water splitting as well as hydrogen adsorption free energy ΔGH∗ on single-atom Fe were also studied. The sequence of promoted splitting activity is found to be Fe@SW > Fe@DV > Fe@SV. Furthermore, by hydrogen adsorption free energy ΔGH∗ analysis, we predict that the HER catalytic activity of graphene nanosheet can be improved by anchoring Fe atom on SV and DV structures, which are comparable to or even better than noble metals. It is found that the catalytic activity of water splitting and HER can be changed with the shift in d-band center with respect to Fermi-level. Detailed investigations on electronic structure of Fe@graphene catalytic systems disclose an obvious orbital hybridization coupling and charge transfer between atom Fe on carbon surfaces and water molecule. These results provide us with new insight into design of high performer and low-cost catalysts and may inspire potential applications in the fields of clean and renewable energy. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {When designing an isolated renewable energy hydrogen refueling station (HRS), it is important to consider the electrical, heating and cooling demands of the supporting building as it is crucial for maintaining the stable HRS operation. Therefore, this paper proposed a new structure of off-grid integrated energy system (OIES) for an isolated renewable energy HRS, which can meet the hydrogen load of the market and the three kinds of loads of the supporting building. The OIES in question consists of wind generators, PV panels, batteries, electrolyzers, heat storage tanks, hydrogen tanks, and absorption chillers. A mixed integer quadratic constrained programming (MIQCP) model of the OIES is built based on the minimization of the total life cycle cost (TLCC). It is built to obtain the optimal solution for sizing and the equipment units’ scheduling strategy. To accord with the actual situation, the electrical, heating, and cooling loads of the supporting building in the simulation are obtained by the EnergyPlus software. Furthermore, the ‘community’ hydrogen demand is obtained by the HOMER software. The results indicate that the proposed structure meets a wide array of energy demands and is more sensible solution when compared to other configurations with one component less. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the influence of economic data, meteorological data, and hydrogen load on TLCC are performed. These results show that the capital and replacement cost of the PV panels are the major economic factors influencing the TLCC. They also confirm that the PV is the system's main component due to a high correlation between the hourly hydrogen demand per year and the hourly solar radiation per year. Lastly, the effects of meteorological data and hydrogen load are also quantitatively analyzed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {An economic prediction model of hydrogen production from renewable energy complemented with off-peak electricity is developed, and the cost of carbon emission for the off-peak electricity from grid is also considered. The variation of hydrogen cost with the utilization hours of off-peak electricity and the allowable range of off-peak electricity utilization hours under different carbon prices and grid average emission factors are investigated. The results show that it is influenced by the multiplication product of the carbon price and the average carbon emission factor of the grid electricity. The use of off-peak electricity reduces the cost of hydrogen when the multiplication product is less than a critical value, while it causes an increase in the cost of hydrogen when larger than the critical value. Off-peak electricity utilization hours are also constrained by the emission intensity requirement of low-carbon or clean hydrogen. In addition, a generalized multivariate coupled analysis method is developed by investigating single variable sensitivities and decision needs at different stages of the project. The results show that the key coupling variables in the site selection stage are hydrogen price, renewable energy utilization hours and integrated tariff, which is determined by both renewable energy and off-peak grid electricity. In the scheme design stage the key coupling variables are electrolysis energy consumption and unit installed cost. When project parameters are determined along with site specific hydrogen price and renewable energy tariffs, further scheme optimization can be undertaken. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In 2021, the world's total installed capacity of generation units based on renewable energy sources (not including hydropower) amounted to about 1674 GW: over 825 GW and 849 GW of wind and solar power plants were installed respectively. The growing of the installed capacity of these distributed generators is a response to the increasing the power consumption, global environmental issues and has also become possible due to the development of technology in field of power semiconductor devices. However, on the way of large-scale implementation of distributed generators based on renewable energy sources, traditional electric power system meets new challenges to ensure the reliability and sustainability of new electric power systems with renewable energy sources. In particular, distributed generators change processes in the electric power system, impact to the parameters and power balance, change the magnitude and direction of power flow and short-circuit current, which determines the need to update the settings of the relay protection and automation systems of traditional electric power system and to coordinate their operation with automatic control systems of installed distributed generators. The above-mentioned tasks form a number of scientific research directions, one of which is a task of determining optimal size and location of distributed generators. The main purpose of this optimization task is to reduce power losses, operating and total electricity cost, improve the voltage profile, etc. In addition, the correct and reasonable placement of distributed generators defines an effective planning of the operating modes of electric power system and power plants (especially based on renewable energy sources, the operating modes of which depend on weather conditions and can be sharply variable). The paper highlighted the impacts of distributed generators on power losses, the voltage level, maintaining the power balance and the possibility of participating in the frequency regulation, and short-circuit current in power system. The optimization criteria, the main limiting conditions, as well as methods for solving this optimization problem are considered. This review will help the System operators and investing companies, especially in Russia, to form the main aim, objective function and constraints that will aid to meet their load demand at minimum cost and to choose from the options available for optimization of location and capacity of distributed generators. © 2022},

	abstract = {Europe and North America have numerous studies on 100% renewable power systems. South America, however, lacks research on zero-carbon energy systems, especially understanding South America as an interconnected region, despite its great renewable energy sources, increasing population, and economic productivity. This work extends the cost-optimization energy planning model LEELO and applies it to South America. This results in the to-date most complete model for planning South America's power sector, with a high temporal (8760 time steps per year) and spatial (over 40 nodes) resolution, and 30 technologies involved. Besides the base case, we study how varying spatial resolution for South America impacted investment results (43, 30, 16, 1 node). Finally, we also evaluate green hydrogen export scenarios, from 0% to 20% on top of the electricity demand. Our study reveals that South America's energy transition will rely, in decreasing order, on solar photovoltaic, wind, gas as bridging technology, and also on some concentrated solar power. Storage technologies equal to about 10% of the total installed power capacity would be required, aided by the existing hydropower fleet. Not only is the transition to renewables technically possible, but it is also the most cost-efficient solution: electricity costs are expected to reach 32 €/MWh from the year 2035 onwards without the need for further fossil fuels. Varying the spatial resolution, the most-resolved model (43 nodes) reveals 11% and 6% more costs than the one-node and one-node-per-country (16) models, respectively, with large differences in investment recommendations, especially in concentrated solar and wind power. The difference between 43 and 30 nodes is negligible in terms of total costs, energy storage, and technology mix, indicating that 30 nodes are an adequate resolution for this region. We then use the 30-node model to analyze hydrogen export scenarios. The electricity costs drop, as hydrogen is not only a load but also a flexibility provider. Most green hydrogen is produced in Chile, Argentina, and northeast Brazil. For future work, we propose to do an integrated energy plan, including transport and heat, for the region, as well as modeling local hydrogen demands.

Two important factors, that determine whether the hydrogen will be imported or produced locally from renewable energy are still uncertain though - the import price for green hydrogen and the upper limit for photovoltaic installations. To investigate the impact of these two factors, the authors calculate cost optimized climate neutral energy systems while varying the import price from 1.25 €/kg to 5 €/kg with unlimited import volume and the photovoltaic limit from 300 GW to unlimited. In all scenarios, hydrogen plays a significant role. At a medium import price of 3.75 €/kg and photovoltaic limits of 300–900 GW the hydrogen supply is around 1200 to 1300 TWh with import shares varying from 60 to 85%.

	abstract = {Renewable hydrogen is increasingly recognized as one of the key decarbonisation options compatible with the EU's climate neutrality goal. We quantify possible cost reductions for renewable hydrogen production until 2050 through electrolysis with off-grid renewable electricity generation systems. We focus on the use of solar PV and on- and offshore wind energy in 30 European countries. We project that towards 2050 hydrogen production costs can fall below 2 €/kg in several countries in Europe. Hybrid configurations, consisting of both onshore wind and solar PV electricity generation, generally result in lower renewable hydrogen production costs. Systems with a relatively high level of full load hours benefit from a reduced share of investment costs for the electrolyser component. The levelized cost of hydrogen produced via solar PV systems can only compete with wind-based systems when significant electrolyser cost reductions are realized, despite the ultimately low expected levelized costs of solar PV-based electricity generation. The novelty of this analysis is that it proffers an overview of the dependencies of the costs of green hydrogen production, and how these costs could decrease over the forthcoming decades across a large set of European countries. Specifically, we show how the dynamics behind the projected renewable hydrogen production costs per country highlight the role that technological learning could have in identifying the most suitable locations for hydrogen production. © 2021},

	abstract = {The development of cost-effective non-precious metal electrocatalysts is a major challenge for water splitting applications, but it is important for the realization of renewable energy systems. Alloying has proved an effective way to design metal-based electrocatalysts, and by controlling the annealing temperature, the surface morphology and crystallinity of the alloy can be tuned to control the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. In this work, with a simple coprecipitation method, we have prepared Co2FeAl alloys at different annealing temperatures (550 °C–670 °C), which exhibit excellent crystallinity and electrocatalytic performance for HER in alkaline solution. Among all conditions, the Co2FeAl alloys prepared at 620 °C shows the better crystallinity and the higher purity, and it could achieve a low overpotential of 149 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline solution. The overpotential demonstrates persistent stability with only 3 mV change after over 1000 cycles. Both density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results revealed that alloying optimizes the electronic structure near the Fermi surface of the system, improving the electron transport efficiency and enhancing the catalytic activity. These Co2FeAl alloys are appealing candidates for high-performance alkaline HER electrocatalytic electrodes in water electrolysis due to their outstanding electrocatalytic properties. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen production is expected to have a major contribution in addressing the global challenge of energy transition and economy decarbonization. In such a transition, wind energy is considered as one of the principal electricity sources for H2 production, both because it is a sustainable source and owing to the intermittency of the wind resource. In recent years, new wind farms have gradually moved offshore, due to better wind resource quality and due to limited space onshore. However, a mismatch between instantaneous wind energy availability and electricity demand often leads to wasting some of the wind resource, usually referred to as curtailment events. Such an excess energy could be used to produce hydrogen and thus make efficient and integrated use of the available equipment and resources. The present work analyzes the feasibility of hydrogen production employing electricity generated from wind energy, taking the WindFloat Atlantic offshore wind farm and Portugal's electricity market as a case-study. Two scenarios are considered. Scenario 1 assumes the WindFloat Atlantic wind farm's present capacity of 25.2 MW and scenario 2 considers a long-term commercial phase of 150 MW integrated in a developed hydrogen economy with pipelines for H2 distribution. In both scenarios a readily available PEM electrolyzer system is employed and the benefits of complementary oxygen sales are estimated. The availability of the wind resource and occurrence of different wind conditions for the particular location is estimated from the wind energy atlas. Afterwards, correlations between the renewable energy production and wholesale electricity price in the Iberian market are established by processing the data corresponding to the year 2019 and taking seasonal variations into account. For each of scenarios, two cases are considered. Case A assumes hydrogen is produced only at night whereas Case B allows for production both during nights and afternoons. Results show Case B and oxygen sales contribute to a more economically feasible project. For Case B and assuming a H2 selling price of 8 €/kg, discount rate (10%) and corporate tax of 21%, results show scenario 2 is the only profitable solution, due to the long-term lower costs. Scenario 1 appears to be feasible only with government incentives. The ratio between the hydrogen plant power and wind farm capacity (PPR) has a significant impact on the H2 production, with results showing a minimum in H2 cost for a ratio of approximately 30%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A large deployment of energy storage solutions will be required by the stochastic and non-controllable nature of most renewable energy sources when planning for higher penetration of renewable electricity into the energy mix. Various solutions have been suggested for dealing with medium- and long-term energy storage. Hydrogen and ammonia are two of the most frequently discussed as they are both carbon-free fuels. In this paper, the authors analyse the energy and cost efficiency of hydrogen and ammonia-based pathways for the storage, transportation, and final use of excess electricity from an offshore wind farm. The problem is solved as a linear programming problem, simultaneously optimising the size of each problem unit and the respective time-dependent operational conditions. As a case study, we consider an offshore wind farm of 1.5 GW size located in a reference location North of Scotland. The energy efficiency and cost of the whole chain are evaluated and compared with competitive alternatives, namely, batteries and liquid hydrogen storage. The results show that hydrogen and ammonia storage can be part of the optimal solution. Moreover, their use for long-term energy storage can provide a significant, cost-effective contribution to an extensive penetration of renewable energy sources in national energy systems. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {One of the limitations of the efficiency of renewable energy sources is the stochastic nature of generation; consequently, it is necessary to use high-capacity energy storage systems such as hydrogen storage for its integration into existing power networks. At the same time, electricity market tariffs for large enterprises change during the day. Therefore, it can be assumed that storing energy during cheaper hours and usage in more expensive hours allows increasing the efficiency of renewable energy sources. Evaluation of the economic efficiency of an energy storage system requires simulation with a step of at least 1 h for several years since the use of averaged production volume and averaged electricity tariffs will not allow obtaining an adequate to the task accuracy.

	abstract = {Improving the performance and the production of renewable energy sources, especially the wind energy, is considered an attractive approach to reduce the Cost of Energy (COE) associated to the hydrogen generation process. In this context, flow control strategies have been object of detailed investigation during last years. Originally flow control devices were designed to be implemented in the aeronautical sector. Nonetheless, the optimization of the performance of the wind turbine blades with the introduction and implementation of these devices is being widely investigated these days. An analysis of the influence of implementing Vortex Generators (VGs) and Gurney Flaps (GFs) in Wind Turbine Blades (WTBs) on the Annual Energy Production (AEP) of large Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) is proposed in this paper. For that purpose, the Weibull distributions of annual wind speed data series of a real wind farm have been calculated, and Blade Element Momentum (BEM) based calculations have been performed to evaluate the effect of the flow control devices on the power curve and the AEP of the NREL offshore 5 MW Baseline Wind Turbine. The obtained results show an enhancement of the AEP of the turbine of 2.43% during year 2015 and 2.68% during year 2016. As a result, increments of the generated hydrogen volume larger than 130000 Nm3 are achieved during both years with no considerable additional cost in the design of the wind turbine. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) is pivotal to phasing out fossil fuel-based energy systems. It can be produced from different sources and using different technologies. Very few studies comprehensively discuss all available state-of-the-art technologies for H2 production, the challenges facing each process, and their economic feasibility and sustainability. The current study thus addresses these gaps to effectively direct future research towards improving H2 production techniques. Many conventional methods contribute to large greenhouse gas footprints, with high production costs and low efficiency. Steam methane reforming and coal gasification dominate the supply side of H2, due to their low production costs (<$3.50/kg). Water-splitting offers one of the most environmentally benign production methods when integrated with renewable energy sources. However, it is considerably expensive and ridden with the flaw of production of harmful by-products that affect efficiency. Fossil fuel processing technologies remain one of the most efficient forms of H2 production sources, with yields exceeding 80% and reaching up to 100%, with the lowest cost despite their high reliance on expensive catalysts. Whereas solar-driven power systems cost slightly less than $10 kg−1, coal gasification and steam reforming cost below $3.05 kg−1. Future research thus needs to be directed towards cost reduction of renewable energy-based H2 production systems, as well as in their decarbonization and designing more robust H2 storage systems that are compatible with long-distance distribution networks with adequate fuelling stations. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production through electrolysis using renewable electricity is considered a major pathway and component for a sustainable energy system of the future. For this production pathway, a high renewable energy potential, especially in solar energy, is crucial. Countries like Germany with a high energy demand and low solar potential strongly depend on hydrogen import. In the present work, a case study with two alternative hydrogen supply options is conducted to evaluate the economic viability of solar hydrogen delivered to a hydrogen pipeline in Stuttgart, Germany. For both options, hydrogen is generated through an 8 MW alkaline electrolyser, solar powered and supported by grid-based electricity to meet the required load. The first option is based on a hydrogen production system that is positioned in Sines, Portugal, an area with high global radiation and proximity to a deep sea port. The hydrogen is processed by liquefaction and transported to Stuttgart by tanker ship via Hamburg and by truck. The second supply option uses an on-site hydrogen production system in Stuttgart. The work shows that the production costs in Sines with 2.09 €/kgH2 (prices in €2021) are, as expected, significantly lower than in Stuttgart with 3.24 €/kgH2. However, this price difference of 1.15 €/kgH2 for hydrogen production drops to a marginal difference of 0.13 €/kgH2 when considering the whole value chain to the delivery point in Stuttgart. If the waste heat from electrolysis is used in a district heating system in Stuttgart, the price difference is down to 0.03 €/kgH2. The first supply option is dominated by costs for processing, especially liquefaction. These costs would need to be reduced to fully exploit the cost advantage of solar hydrogen production in Portugal. Also, a fundamental switch to pipeline transport of gaseous hydrogen should be considered.

Interest in hydrogen technologies will also increase, especially due to the smart cities concept and the increase in renewable energy supply. In addition to being a clean energy source, the tendency of hydrogen to 100% renewable energy supply makes it ahead of other alternative fuels. The share of hydrogen and related energy technologies in reducing global warming and emissions will continue to increase day by day. For this reason, projections and investment opportunities should be determined for the coming years. In energy projections, the evaluation of hydrogen in terms of energy diversity until 2030 is carried out with EnergyPlan software. Accordingly, the reduction in the amount of emissions and costs were determined by mixing hydrogen into the natural gas pipelines by 5–10, and 20% by volume by producing electrolyzers with photovoltaic systems and according to the number of vehicles with fuel cells in the transportation sector until 2030. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production from water splitting is considered one of the most environmentally friendly processes for replacing fossil fuels. Among the various technologies to produce hydrogen from water splitting, thermochemical cycles using chemical reagents have the advantage of scale up compared to other specific facilities or geological conditions required. According to thermochemical processes using chemical redox reactions, 2-, 3-, 4-step thermochemical water splitting cycles can generate hydrogen more efficiently due to reducing temperatures. Increasing the number of cycles or steps of thermochemical hydrogen production could reduce the required maximum temperature of the facility. In addition, recently developed hybrid thermochemical processes combined with electricity or solar energy have been studied on a large scale because of the reduced cost of hydrogen production. Additionally, hybrid thermochemical water splitting combined with renewable energy can result in not only reducing the cost, but also increasing hydrogen production efficiency in terms of energy. As for a green energy, hydrogen production from water splitting using sustainable and renewable energy is significant to protect biological environment and human health. Additionally, hybrid thermochemical water splitting is conducive to large scale hydrogen production.

	abstract = {Hydrogen as an energy carrier can play a significant role in reducing environmental emissions if it is produced from renewable energy resources. This research aims to assess hydrogen production from wind energy considering environmental, economic, and technical aspect for the East Azerbaijan province of Iran. The economic assessment is performed by calculation of payback period, levelized cost of hydrogen, and levelized cost of electricity. Since uncertainty in the power output of wind turbines may affect the payback period, all calculations are performed for four different turbine degradation rates. While it is common in the literature to choose the wind turbine based on a single criterion, this study implements Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques for this purpose. The results of Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis illustrates that economic issue is the most important criterion for this research. The results of Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment shows that Vestas V52 is the most suitable wind turbine for Ahar and Sarab cities, while Eovent EVA120 H-Darrieus is a better choice for other stations. The most suitable location for wind power generation is found to be Ahar, where it is estimated to annually generate 2914.8 kWh of electricity at the price of 0.045 $/kWh, and 47.2 tons of hydrogen at the price of 1.38 $/kg, which result in 583 tons of CO2 emission reduction. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The cross-regional consumption of renewable energy can effectively solve the problem of the uneven spatial distribution of renewable energy. To explore the application of hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS) for cross-regional consumption of renewable energy, optimal planning of cross-regional HESS considering the uncertainty is researched in this study. Firstly, a two-layer planning model is proposed to consider investment and operation costs. The upper layer of the model aims to determine a feasible planning strategy for HESS based on existing conditions. The purpose of the lower layer is then to determine the optimal scheduling strategy and minimum operating cost of the system considering uncertainty based on distributionally robust optimization. Furthermore, the solution method that combines the modified Backtracking Search Algorithm (MBSA) and Yalmip/Cplex is utilized to determine the optimal placement and sizing of the HESS. Finally, the simulation experiment is performed with the case of Southwest China to verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning model and corresponding solution method. The simulation results show that the MBSA has a better convergence speed and stronger global search capability performance than the traditional BSA. MBSA converges at 44th, which is quicker than the 60th of BSA; the optimal objective value obtained by MBSA is $1,038,929,953.66, which is better than that of BSA of $1,051,512,303.18. In addition, the resulting HESS planning scheme can effectively reduce the network loss of the system, reduce the peak-to-valley load difference, and improve renewable energy consumption. Specifically, the system network loss is reduced from 1.56 MWh to 1.47 MWh, the peak-to-valley difference is reduced from 245.61 MW to 225.88 WM, and the total renewable energy consumption of four typical days is increased from 6582.07 MW to 7626.03 MW. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In this model, geothermal-solar-wind multi-energy complementarities are fully explored based on electrolytic thermo-electrochemical effects of geothermal-to-hydrogen (GTH), which are converted, conditioned, and coupled through energy hub. The proposed high-renewable energy hub portfolio is an intractable optimization problem due to their inherent strong energy couplings and conflicted energy cost/risk. The original problem is thus characterized through the mean-variance approach to explicitly express the risk associated with the forecast uncertainties. The formulated mean-variance portfolio problem is subsequently modeled as a two-stage mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) stochastic programming to optimally determine appropriate energy generation, conversion, and storage candidates. Numerical studies on a community microgrid are implemented to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology over conventional wind-solar-battery scheme. Simulations results show that the portfolio cost can be reduced by at most 14.9% with a significantly higher operational flexibility. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Fuel cells are one of the most important renewable energy systems. The use of metal foams within the scope of commercialization and cost reduction of fuel cells attracts attention today. Metal foams are a material that provides excellent performance in many engineering applications, especially in fuel cells, thanks to the high permeability provided by the porous structure, narrow flow channels, large specific surface area, capillary, and diffusive forces. Among the metallic foams, the focus is on the use of aluminum foam, due to its low cost, superior strength, and thermal conductivity performance properties as well as ease of production. As an alternative to gas diffusion layers, the use of different metallic foam materials in fuel cell systems and performance improvements were analyzed. The use of aluminum foams as flow distributors and electrodes in the anode diffusion layer, which is one of the DBHYP components, provides significant increases in cell performance, cell weight, and volume. It has been found that open-cell metallic foams used in fuel cell systems cause an increase in performance due to their positive effects on the amount of catalyst coating, flow characteristics, and electrical properties. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In line with the growing pressures on implementing zero-carbon emission policies and the implementation of hydrogen in the transport sector, energy markets are experiencing inevitable transformation and interactions. Since fuel cell electric vehicles have been attracting considerable attention, the production and supply of renewable hydrogen through hydrogen refuelling stations (HRSs) are of great importance. The growing energy demand, inappropriate siting and sizing of HRSs, and high penetration of distributed renewable energy sources (RESs) make power distribution network planning very challenging. This paper proposes an integrated multi-stage and multi-zone expansion planning framework to coordinate the investment and scheduling of HRSs, wind and solar energy sources, and the distribution network. To model the green HRSs, water electrolysers powered by renewable electricity and storage tanks to locally produce and store hydrogen are suggested. The objective of the proposed problem is to minimise the investment, operation, emissions, and maintenance costs of network's assets, RESs, and HRSs. The RESs expansion scheme comprises the installation of two different groups; the former pertains to distributed renewable sources installed over the network while the latter is integrated into HRSs. Case studies are conducted on 6-node and real Australian 100-node distribution networks. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of optimal timing, sizing, location, and operational schedules of HRSs, RESs, and distribution network's assets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Remote areas usually do not have access to electricity from the national grid. The energy demand is often covered by diesel generators, resulting in high operating costs and significant environmental impacts. With reference to the case study of Ginostra (a village on a small island in the south of Italy), this paper analyses the environmental sustainability of an innovative solution based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) integrated with a hybrid hydrogen-battery energy storage system. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been carried out to evaluate if and to what extent the RES-based system could bring environmental improvements compared to the current diesel-based configuration. The results show that the impact of the RES-based system is less than 10% of that of the current diesel-based solution for almost all impact categories (climate change, ozone depletion, photochemical ozone formation, acidification, marine and terrestrial eutrophication and fossil resource use). The renewable solution has slightly higher values only for the following indicators: use of mineral and metal resources, water use and freshwater eutrophication. The climate change category accounts for 0.197 kg CO2 eq./kWh in the renewable scenario and 1.73 kg CO2 eq./kWh in the diesel-based scenario, which corresponds to a reduction in GHG emissions of 89%. By shifting to the RES-based solution, about 6570 t of CO2 equivalent can be saved in 25 years (lifetime of the plant). In conclusion, the hydrogen-battery system could provide a sustainable and reliable alternative for power supply in remote areas. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive approach to design hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) targeting industrial and mobility markets. Even if the inclusion of sustainability criteria is paramount, only a few studies simultaneously consider economic, environmental, and social aspects - the most difficult to measure. In this paper, the safety risk and the social cost-benefit (SCB) have been identified as quantifiable social criteria that would affect society and the end-users. The objectives of this research are (1) to design a sustainable HSC by using four objective functions, i.e., levelized cost of hydrogen, global warming potential, safety risk and social cost-benefit through a mixed-integer linear programming model; (2) to compare results from SCB and multiobjective optimisation. The integration of the SCB criterion at the optimisation stage is not a trivial task and is one of the main contributions of this work. It implies the minimisation of the total cost of ownership (TCO) for buses and trucks. The evolution of the HSC from 2030 to 2050 is studied through a multiobjective and multiperiod optimisation framework using the ε-constraint method. The methodology has been applied to a case study for Hungary with several scenarios to test the sensitivity of demand type and volume as well as the production technology. The results analysis highlights that (1) it is beneficial to have mixed demand (industry and mobility) and a gradual introduction/migration to electrolysis technology and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) for a smooth transition. Liquid hydrogen produced via water electrolysis powered by nuclear and wind energy can result in an average levelized cost of $4.78 and 3.14 kg CO2-eq per kg H2; (2) the frameworks for multiobjective optimisation and SCB maximisation are complementary because they prioritise different aspects to design the HSC. Taxes and surcharges for H2 fuel will impact its final price at the refuelling station resulting in a higher TCO for FCVs compared to diesel buses and trucks in 2030 but the TCO becomes almost competitive for hydrogen trucks from 2035 when SCB is maximised. The SCB function can be refined and easily adapted to include additional externalities. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Environmental degradation and global warming are presently two of the most pressing global concerns. According to the (IAE), around 80% of global energy demand has been met by fossil fuels in recent years, resulting in an increase in CO2 emissions as the primary greenhouse gas. Switching to renewable energy sources and using more energy-efficient energy systems are vital for mitigating environmental challenges and reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, among other things. Hydrogen fuels are primary renewable resources because of their reduced cost and ability to produce net-zero CO2 emissions. In the present study, a system is designed to generate power and liquid hydrogen from geothermal sources. The generated power by employing either the organic Rankin cycle (ORC) or absorption power cycle (APC) is compared to seek the best cycle performance from power generation standpoint. A comprehensive thermodynamic and economic modeling is carried out for the proposed system. In addition, a parametric study is applied to see which parameters affect the performance of the system. Multi-objective optimization is carried out to find the best operating point of the hydrogen liquefaction energy system. The system demonstrates better performance when APC is applied for power generation. The cost of generated liquid hydrogen by ORC and APC is 3.8 $/kg.LH2 and 3.6 $/kg.LH2, respectively. Furthermore, 0.014 $/kWh of electricity cost is reached by ORC compared to 0.012 $/kWh of APC. Parametric analysis shows that the higher the temperature and flow rate of the brine of geothermal fluid, the higher the efficiency and the lower cost. Finally, the multi-objective optimization pinpoints that the system's efficiency and unit product cost at the optimal ORC-based design is 33.85% and 0.0121 $/kWh. In comparison, the APC demonstrates better performance by 34.5% and 0.011 $/kWh. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This study incorporates hydrogen pipeline (HGP), natural gas pipeline (NGP), and Ultra High Voltage (UHV) into an optimal planning model framework and analyzes the optimal transmission mode, quantity, network, and cost of large-scale renewable hydrogen in China. Constructing a sensitivity analysis framework, this study also investigates the optimal transmission mode changes under different scenarios. The results show that the optimal mode of large-scale renewable hydrogen transmission in the province is NGP, and 5.4% of supply level is the critical point to export renewable hydrogen inter-provincially. It switches to the combination of NGP and HGP when the unit transmission costs of these elements decrease to a certain proportion simultaneously or switches to HGP when the unit transmission cost of HGP decreases more than that of NGP. The complementary transmission mode of NGP and UHV is the optimal mode for inter-provincial transmission, and the HGP can be put into use for inter-provincial transmission only when the unit transmission cost of which is reduced to less than 25%. Jilin is the key node in the NGP network, and Tibet and Gansu are the key nodes in UHV network, and the participation or absence of which will have significant impact on the renewable hydrogen transmission system. Only minor adjustments to the transmission technical parameters of NGP or HGP can promote the qualitative overflight of the optimal transmission volume of them so as to achieve the target optimization at the minimum cost. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A novel hybrid renewable-energy-based system for generating multiple commodities is investigated in this study. The heat gained from geothermal and solar energy sources is converted into useful products such as electricity, domestic hot water, cooling load, and hydrogen via an integrated energy system including parabolic trough collectors, a Kalina cycle, an ejector refrigeration system, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) unit, an organic Rankine cycle, and a PEM electrolyzer. A comprehensive analysis based on energy, exergy, and exergoeconomic methods is carried out to examine the system from different standpoints. To achieve the finest solution, multi-objective optimization is performed to simultaneously maximize exergy efficiency and minimize the total unit cost of products. The results indicate that, under the optimal condition, the system can attain 35.2% and 37.8 $/GJ, and 1.9 kg/h for exergy efficiency, the total unit cost of products, and hydrogen production rate, respectively. Moreover, by comparing system performance for the base case through a parametric study with and without TEG, it is determined that utilizing this unit could be more beneficial for the total system. However, the result achieved from a case study suggests that it would be economically wise to remove the TEG unit during some cold months. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {For green hydrogen production, the choice of the appropriate renewable energy source to drive the water electrolysis process is crucial. Currently, solar Photovoltaic (PV) energy is one of the most popular and cheapest renewable energy sources; however, the performance of this technology is highly affected by the weather condition especially after the exposition to harsh climate conditions for long periods. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to assess the appropriate PV technology for hydrogen production under the impact of arid climatic conditions. For this reason, we evaluated the hydrogen production from 3 PV technologies, namely: monocrystalline (m-Si), polycrystalline (p-Si) and amorphous (a-Si) technologies exposed outdoors for a period of 3 years under the arid climatic conditions of Errachidia, Morocco. In addition, the degradation rate of each technology has been calculated and its impact on hydrogen production and its cost has been investigated. The results show that, the technology with the higher yearly hydrogen yield is the p-Si with 37.07 kg/kWp, followed by the m-Si with 36.84 kg/kWp and finally the a-Si with 36.68 kg/kWp. As for the cost of hydrogen production, the lowest cost was found in the case of the p-Si technology as well with 4.89 $/kg, whereas for the m-Si and a-Si technologies it was found equal to 5.48 $/kg and 6.28 $/kg respectively. However, the evaluation the impact of the PV modules degradation reveals that p-Si is technology affect the most with an annual degradation rate of 0.92%, followed by the a-Si with 0.72% and m-Si technologies with 0.45%. Nonetheless, when taken in consideration the impact of the degradation on the cost of hydrogen production, the p-Si remain the most cost effective technology even though the cost has increase to 5.32 $/kg, 5.78 $/kg and 6.67 $/kg for the p-Si, m-Si and a-Si technologies respectively. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen finds its vital role in bridging the intermittent supplied renewable energy and fossil fuel infrastructure in a broad energy transition context. The bottleneck still lies in hydrogen's low volumetric energy density, prohibiting long-distance, large-scale, and cost-effective transportation. As a promising hydrogen carrier, ammonia possesses mature production, storage, transportation, and distribution supply chains. These advantages of ammonia enabled the possibility of transforming the renewable hydrogen at a minimum initial cost. This paper investigates the technological and economic feasibility of green ammonia utilization in the Solid Oxide Cells for power generation and energy storage. The result shows that the cost of Ammonia induced energy (183.75 US$/MWh) is significantly higher than that of natural gas power plants (81.77 US$/MWh). The main contributor is the fuel cost. In the optimum case, with fuel costs substantially dropping, the conceptual plant can be highly feasible, and the generated energy (97.40 USS$/MWh) is comparable to the conventional power plant. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The MH compressor shows limited environmental impacts only when a source of waste heat is available for hydrogen desorption. In these case, impacts would be similar to a generic compressor, but larger than those generated by an air booster. The equivalent economic cost is 6 € per kg of compressed hydrogen for the MH compressor, which is much higher than for the air booster, but lower than for a generic hydrogen compressor.

In the pursuit of this objective, a novel geothermal-driven system consisting of steam and organic Rankine cycles, high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), and thermoelectric generator (TEG), NH3 synthesis unit is proposed for power, NH3/H2/O2 productions. The produced hydrogen is completely consumed. Fraction of hydrogen produced by SOEC is injected into the boiler for power generation through the SRC, and the remaining is fed into an ammonia synthesis unit to produce NH3. Moreover, the TEG is used as the condenser to increase system efficiency through waste heat recovery. The proposed system is comprehensively analyzed from energy, exergy, economic, and sustainability perspectives. Also, parametric analysis is conducted to evaluate the effect of important design parameters such as geothermal mass fraction ratio, H2 mass fraction ratio, N2 feeding rate, ammonia reactor pressure, and temperature on the performance and economic indicators of the power plant. Furthermore, comparative multi-objective optimization via the evolutionary genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is developed in MATLAB to optimize the energy system. Moreover, two different scenarios for the optimization process were considered to compare the optimum solution points with each other. The results show that considering sustainability index and total cost rate as the target functions, by assigning the [Formula presented] = 250, ΔTpp = 11.83, j = 2400 A/m2 and [Formula presented] = 0.76, the highest achievable sustainability index and minimum cost rate are 1.875 and 328.94 $/h, respectively.

The energy system consisting of wind turbines, solar photovoltaic (PV), fuel cell (FC), electrolyzer, hydrogen storage, and battery energy storage is intended to power a residential load in Lagos Nigeria. Based on the economic metric, the results show that the optimal system is a PV-Battery whose total net present cost (TNPC) and initial investment cost are $9060 and $3,818, respectively. However, if the energy systems are ranked based on multiple criteria (economic, technical and environmental aspects), the most preferred of the feasible energy systems is a hybrid PV-FC-wind-battery (TNPC-$10,324, initial cost: $7670). The study results indicate that, for viability in the adoption of hydrogen energy storage as part of the hybrid energy system, the selection metric should be based on more than one criterion. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen has been widely accepted as the best alternative energy carrier to store intermittent renewable energies. Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) represents a promising technology to produce highly pure hydrogen with high efficiency and low footprint. While great progress has been made on components, materials and even fabrication processes, new materials or complicated processes still require refinement in the process of continuously improving PEMWE performance and durability. In this study, we demonstrate a facile treatment on membranes, aiming at improving cell performance at low costs. By adopting the hydration in DI water or 0.5 M H2SO4, or by varying the treatment sequence with the catalyst layer deposition, the PEMWE performance was tuned with the overpotential improvement as high as 50 mV at 2.0 A cm−2. The PEMWE cells after different treatments were characterized both ex-situ and in-situ, and the mechanism was also proposed. The H2SO4 treatment swelled the micro micelle structure of the Nafion membranes, resulting in a higher proton conductivity and better cell performance compared with those from DI water treatment. In addition, the treatment sequence also had great impact, and the treatment after the catalyst layer deposition would result in better performance due to the reduced resistance and better kinetics. Not only the types of membrane, but also the thickness should be measured and reported when tested, which is more critical when compared across the published works from different groups. This work could also provide a guideline for future membrane treatment and PEMWE cell testing. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The article proposes a methodological approach to the development of the tools for studying the international electro-hydrogen system creation in Northeast Asia. The term “hydrogen carrier” was introduced and its definition was given. The resource, economic and technological prerequisites for the development of the unified regional infrastructure to produce, transfer, transform and utilise both electricity and “hydrogen carriers” for consumers of energy services are considered. The author points out the need for a comprehensive consideration of technological, economic, social and political factors when developing such a complex technical system, which affects the diverse actors' interests. In order to create mutual understanding and balance the stakeholders’ interests, the tool to evaluate the efficiency of such a system is necessary. The use of mathematical models is becoming one of the most vital and widespread techniques employed for this purpose. Thereby, the article deals with the structure and the development stages of a regional electro-hydrogen model for Northeast Asia. The review of models that address the issues of hydrogen technologies and renewable energy integration into energy supply systems is given. The main types of models used to describe such technical and economic systems are identified and it is concluded that the development of a two-level modelling system is necessary. The production and transport models at the upper (international) level should be the core of the proposed models system. At the lower level (the “green hydrogen carriers” production), the models of optimal resource management are required to determine the composition and parameters of the technological equipment. Step-by-step development of the modelling system is proposed. The first stage is the simplest scenario where only solar and wind energy is considered as an energy source. At this stage, it is possible to weed out inefficient technologies and identify targeted technologies and mechanisms for multilateral regional cooperation. The second stage should balance the interests of the actors and stakeholders. Here, the traditional renewable energy (biomass, hydro and pumped storage) along with carbon (thermal) and nuclear power generation, as well as other (“carbon”) hydrogen technologies will become available for consideration. The final, third stage of the research tools development, will require separate accounting of “green” and “carbon” energy to consider certification mechanisms and energy pricing when building the international hydrogen system in Northeast Asia. In conclusion, the structure of the first stage production and transport model is described. This model will allow estimating the comparative effectiveness of different electric and hydrogen technologies to deliver green energy to consumers in the Northeast Asian economies. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This paper aims to optimize and techno-economic analyzes a mixed power system for the deployment of modern cellular mobile infrastructure in the fifth-generation era cleanly and sustainably. The objective is to shift from the conventional grid-diesel to a cleaner and more competitive electric power model. The optimal model comprising a hybrid wind/photovoltaic/fuel cell power conversion and hydrogen storage modules linked to the grid was developed by using the energy-equilibrium strategy of the HOMER Pro software. Whereas the objective function was analyzed based on cost, the mixed power system was constrained to satisfy the energy demand reliably and competitively. Process simulations were executed to finalize the optimal sizing, and techno-economic implications of the mixed energy system, using 22-year meteorological datasets collected for a survey site (latitude 12°59.5′N and longitude 7°36.2′E). The optimum design size improves the unreliable grid with a renewable portion of 98.8% at $ 0.03602 per kWh, and an energy cost cutback of 91.5% at 43.9% return on investment could be gained with a payback period of fewer than 3 years. This could facilitate the switch from a grid-diesel energy pathway to a cleaner and sustainable alternative thereby decarbonizing the immediate operational environment and the city at large. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The use of low-carbon hydrogen is being considered to help decarbonize several jurisdictions around the world. There may be opportunities for energy-exporting countries to supply energy-importing countries with a secure source of low-carbon hydrogen. The study objective is to assess the delivered cost of gaseous hydrogen export from Canada (a fossil-resource rich country) to the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and inland destinations in North America. There is a data gap on the feasibility of inter-continental export of hydrogen from an energy-producing jurisdiction to energy-consuming jurisdictions. This study is aimed at addressing this gap and includes an assessment of opportunities across the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, based on fundamental engineering-based models. Techno-economics were used to determine the delivered cost of hydrogen to these destinations. The modelling considers energy, material, and capacity-sizing requirements for a five-stage supply chain comprising hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage, hydrogen pipeline transportation, liquefaction, shipping, and regasification at the destinations. The results show that the delivered cost of hydrogen to inland destinations in North America is between CAD$4.81/kg and CAD$6.03/kg, to the Asia-Pacific from CAD$6.65/kg to CAD$6.99/kg, and at least CAD$8.14/kg for exports to Europe. Delivering hydrogen by blending in existing long-distance natural gas pipelines reduced the delivered cost to inland destinations by 17%. Exporting ammonia to the Asia-Pacific provides cost savings of 28% compared to shipping liquified hydrogen. The developed information may be helpful to policymakers in government and the industry in making informed decisions about international trade of low-carbon hydrogen in both energy-exporting and energy-importing jurisdictions, globally. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is gradually becoming one of the important carriers of global energy transformation and development. To analyze the influence of the hydrogen storage module (HSM) on the operation of the gas-electricity integrated energy system, a comprehensive energy system model consisting of wind turbines, gas turbines, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) unit, and HSM is proposed in this paper. The model couples the natural gas network and power grid bidirectionally, and establishes a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem considering HSM. The linearization model of the natural gas pipeline flow equation and the generator set equation is constructed by piecewise linearization method to improve the efficiency of solving the model. And the energy flow distribution in the gas-electricity integrated energy system is finally solved. In Model 1, compared with not considering the installation of P2H units, when the hydrogen doping ratio is 10%, the operating cost can be reduced by 6.63%, and the wind curtailment cost can be reduced by 17.54%, and the carbon emission can be reduced by 298.7 tons. The optimization results of Model 2 reveal that compared with no HSM, the system operating cost is reduced by 5.96%, the hydrogen content level in the natural gas pipeline network is increased by 42.12%, and the carbon emission of the system is reduced by 117.6 tons, and the fluctuation of wind power is suppressed.

	abstract = {Renewable energy has rapidly advanced in the global energy system, triggering the visible development of energy storage technologies in recent decades. Among them, the electricity-fuel-electricity approach is an effective way for the storage and utilization of renewable power. In this work, a bifunctional electrochemical flow cell integrating both ammonia production and electricity generation modes is developed for renewable energy conversion and storage. Ammonia, a hydrogen carrier having a high hydrogen content of 17.6 wt %, is relatively easier to convert to liquid phase for large-scale storage. The long-distance ammonia transport can reliably depend on the established infrastructure. In addition, as a carbon-free fuel beneficial for achieving the goal of carbon-neutrality, ammonia is considered as an environmentally benign and cost-effective mediator fuel. This flow cell is able to operate via two modes, i.e., an ammonia-production mode for energy storage in the form of ammonia (via nitrogen reduction reaction) and an electricity-generation mode for energy conversion in the form of electricity (via ammonia oxidation reaction). This flow cell is constituted by a PtAu/C-coated nickel-foam electrode for nitrogen and oxygen reduction reactions, a Pt/C-coated nickel-foam electrode for water and ammonia oxidation reactions, and an alkaline anion exchange membrane for charge-carrier migration. Charging this flow cell with the supply of nitrogen results in a Faradaic efficiency of 2.70% and an ammonia production rate as high as 9.34 × 10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 at 23 °C. Moreover, energizing this flow cell with ammonia results in an open-circuit voltage of 0.59 V and a peak power density of 3.31 mW cm−2 at 23 °C. A round-trip efficiency of 25.7% is realized with the constant-electrode mode. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Dynamic models for predicting the power consumption, hydrogen production and temperature are identified, and the verified fit is 96.31%, 97.87%, 87.73%, respectively, which demonstrated the accuracy of the identification model. Subsequently, the identification model was used to predict the dynamic behavior of HT-PEMEC and design control strategies. Fuzzy control strategy and neural network predictive control strategy are implemented to alleviate overshoot and suppress fluctuations so as to improve the durability of the electrolyzer. Moreover, compared with the fuzzy control strategy, the neural network predictive control strategy reduces the power overshoot by approximately 92%.

This paper reviews different kinds of MOF-related electrocatalysts, involving metals, metal oxides, single atoms, metal phosphides, metal nitrides, and metal dichalcogenides for hydrogen production. Also, MOF-based photocatalysts consisting of pristine MOFs, MOFs as supporters, and MOF-derived heterojunction architectures are reviewed. The finding of MOF-based catalysts for hydrogen generation is summarized. The pros and cons of different MOF-based materials as catalysts for water splitting are discussed.

	abstract = {Demands for the decline of CO2 emissions resulted in a significant transformation of the energy systems working on carbon sources towards more sustainable, clean, and renewable characteristics. Hydrogen is emerging as a secondary energy vector with ever-increasing importance in the decarbonisation progress. Indeed, hydrogen, a green and renewable energy source, could be produced from steam gasification of plant-originated lignocellulosic biomass. In this current review, key factors affect the hydrogen production yield from steam gasification of plant-originated lignocellulosic biomass, including the design of the gasifier, temperature, pressure, and steam-to-biomass ratio, steam flow rate, moisture and particle size of fed biomass, and catalysts were thoroughly analysed. Moreover, the effects of the abovementioned factors on the reduction of tar formation, which is also a key parameter towards ensuring the trouble-free operation of the reactor, were critically evaluated. More importantly, the separation of produced hydrogen from steam gasification of biomass and challenges over technological, environmental, and economic aspects of biomass gasification were also presented in detail. In addition, this paper is also profiling the prospect of Vietnam in fulfilling its hydrogen economy potential because Vietnam has vast biomass due to its tropical weather and availability of arable land, providing abundant lignocellulosic biomass with 45% of agricultural waste, 30% of firewood, and 25% of other sources. Besides, some primary factors hindering the broad application of biomass for hydrogen production were indicated. Finally, some solutions for implementing the hydrogenization strategy in Vietnam have also been discussed. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Mine sites are an ideal candidate to be decarbonised through the installation of variable renewables and storage. However, the operation of mine sites is dependent on many factors, including mineral price, which can vary significantly, leading to periods of inactivity. Therefore, for sites that have invested in renewable generation and storage, there exists a potential of stranded assets, which negatively impact their business case, potentially reducing investment in such equipment and, therefore, decarbonisation potential. The current study therefore has investigated the potential of using variable renewable energy coupled with thermal energy storage and biodiesel to supply heat to a mine site. With the base case established, the economic impact of lower or no mine operations on the net present value were evaluated. To reduce the impact of mine turndown, the potential of installing a hydrogen production facility in an effort to utilise the stranded assets was also undertaken. Preliminary results show the base case to be very economical with a net present cost of $151.4 M after 30 operational years. This value was reduced to $45.7 M and -$81.1 M if the mine only operated at half capacity or did not operate at all, respectively. The addition of hydrogen production powered by the installed variable renewable generation resulted in a slightly better net present value of $174.7 M if the mine operated as normal for 30 years. For the two other cases, the installation of an electrolyser resulted in significantly better results than if it had not been installed for the half capacity and no operation cases with net present costs of $90.9 M and -$7.1 M, respectively. A sensitivity analysis on these results show that while the hydrogen production only plays a minor role in site savings, a price of between $1.1/kg to $2.0/kg is necessary for the system to be economically justifiable. Therefore, the current study shows that the addition of an electrolyser can significantly reduce the risk of stranded assets in fully renewable mine sites by providing an additional revenue stream during mine turndown events. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Growing energy demand is inevitable in the future, due to increased commercialization and industrialization. Biohydrogen production from renewable biomass is considered as clean energy technology and, in this study, the feasibility of using Sargassum tennerimum as a renewable energy source has been attempted. Pretreatment using sonication pretreatment (ST) and surfactant Dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate (DOSS) mediated ultrasonic pretreatment (DOSSSP) were investigated and the optimized pretreatment time and sonication power, respectively, were 30 and 200W for ST. DOSS dosage of 0.005 g/g TS was found to be optimum for DOSSSP with the corresponding maximum of 2600 mg/L and 27.36% respectively for sCOD (Soluble chemical oxygen demand) release and COD (Chemical oxygen demand) solubilization percentage. Biohydrogen assay analysis of the pretreated algal biomass was carried out and 86 mL/g COD of maximum biohydrogen production was achieved for DOSSSP pretreated sample than ST and control owing to higher COD solubilization percentage, carbohydrate and protein release. Energy analysis was performed to test the economic viability of the pretreatment process. This analysis showed that the maximum net positive energy of 0.0407 and energy ratio of 2.43 was obtained for DOSSSP revealing its economic viability.

	abstract = {The sustainable nature of renewable energy, with its vast resource potential and reduced costs, has triggered a rapid increase in its direct utilization in a solar/wind-electricity manner. As the installed capacity increases, cost-effective and efficient technologies for renewable energy storage and utilization will be critically important to mitigate the intermittency of the solar and wind resources and maintain the stability of electrical grid. In this work, we demonstrate a discrete regenerative fuel cell, mediated by ammonia, capable of converting and storing intermittent power in an electricity-fuel-electricity approach. During energy storage (electricity to fuel), charging an electrolysis flow cell for ammonia production from nitrogen and water results in a Faradaic efficiency of 2.18% and a rate performance of 15.03 × 10-10 mol s−1 cm−2 at 23 oC, which is one order of magnitude higher than those reported in the open literature. During energy utilization (fuel to electricity), energizing a flow cell with ammonia results in a peak power density of 8.86 mW cm−2 at 80 °C. Hence, a discrete regenerative fuel cell mediated by ammonia for renewable energy storage and utilization is demonstrated, which represents a promising alternative choice for the regenerative fuel cell mediated by hydrogen in terms of storage, transportation, distribution, and dispensation costs, as well as safety issues. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Various metal oxidation states and oxygen vacancies at the surface of Co2FeO4@rGO composites guided the multifunctional surface properties.

	abstract = {The central ecological area of the Baikal natural territory covers some districts of the Irkutsk oblast and the Republic of Buryatia, located on the coast of the Lake Baikal. Due to the natural uniqueness and special status of doing economic activity, the assessment of the impact on the environment in this territory is very importance. An analysis of the functioning of energy objects showed that a significant part of the territory is provided with a centralized electricity supply with developed electric grid infrastructure. There are only a few remote settlements with autonomous electricity supply from diesel power plants. The main sources of pollution are numerous boiler houses that provide heat to the population, social and administrative institutions. In all, there are 98 heat energy sources in the territory, of which 66 (or 70%) use coal. The problems of environmental pollution are mainly caused by the use of coal in a small boiler house, worn-out equipment, and the lack of an appropriate level of flue gas treatment. The total estimated emission of pollutants into the atmosphere from heat energy sources is estimated at 20–25 thousand tons per year. In order to reduce the anthropogenic impact from energy objects, it is advisable to use renewable energy sources, hydrogen technologies, coal substitution with environmentally friendly fuels, use of electricity for heat energy supply, installation of environmental protection equipment and the implementation of energy-saving measures. The methodological approach and simulation models developed at MESI SB RAS were used to determine the competitiveness conditions of alternative technologies and energy carriers. The studies evaluated the environmental and economic efficiency of energy production technologies by using specific indicators: the capital intensity of reducing 1 ton of emissions and environmental capital return by 1 million rubles for the conditions of the central ecological area. The potential for reducing emissions into the atmosphere by use of renewable energy sources in autonomous energy supply areas is less than 1% of the current level of total emissions from energy objects. The potential for reducing emissions by replacing boiler houses with a capacity of less than 0,2 Gcal/h by a heat pump units is no more than 12%. The biggest environmental effect can be achieved by using alternative energy carriers including hydrogen instead of coal. Moreover, the potential for reducing emissions is 60% of the total emissions. In addition to these activities are the least capital intensive. The most effectively is the replacement of coal with natural gas. Rational gas consumption in the coastal areas of Lake Baikal is estimated at 175–190 thousand tons of equivalent fuel. The real possibility of transferring small boiler houses to gas arises during the construction of an export gas pipeline from Russia (through the territory of the Irkutsk oblast) to China via Mongolia, or by the small-scale production of liquefied natural gas. The most currently implemented direction is the use of electricity for heat energy supply. The potential volume of electricity to replace coal in boiler houses of the central ecological area is 1,3 TWh per year, however, the competitive electricity tariff is estimated less than 2 US c/kWh, which is several times lower than current tariffs. Hydrogen technology is currently very capital-intensive, but using it in a way similar to using electricity for heat eliminates pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. Now days, there are no effective financial mechanisms aimed at stimulating the reduction of the anthropogenic pressure on the environment from existing energy sources, including for the use of alternative technologies. As the result, significant financial support is required in the form of special cost compensation mechanisms for energy producers and/or consumers. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This study develops net-zero energy management and optimization approaches for the commercial building sector in cities powered by renewable energy systems integrated with energy storage of pumped hydro and hydrogen taxis, based on the estimated installation potential of solar photovoltaics and offshore wind power. A novel time-of-use energy management strategy of hybrid renewable energy and storage systems is proposed considering the future-oriented application scenario with high renewable energy generation and shifted peak power periods. Multi-objective optimizations are conducted to find the techno-economic-environmental optimum sizing configurations of the pumped hydro storage. Research results indicate that most of Pareto optimal solutions are achieved with large pumped hydro sizes applied in net-zero energy commercial building sectors. The proposed future-oriented time-of-use strategy significantly improves the system supply and economic performance, in terms of the renewable energy self-consumption (+9.24%), load coverage (+6.10%) and annual electricity bill (-25.21%) compared with the current time-of-use case. Obvious decarbonisation benefits of the renewable power supply and renewable hydrogen mobility are achieved with carbon emission reduction of 95.14% (14713.49 M kg CO2) compared with the traditional grid power supply and 80.74% (293.91 M kg CO2) compared with the traditional petroleum taxis under the future-oriented time-of-use strategy. The proposed net-zero energy planning framework for urban building sectors integrating decarbonized transportation can be applied in similar coastline cities in the globe as important references and guidelines to policymakers for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Power-to-Gas (P2G) is a process that produces a gas from electricity, which is most commonly hydrogen via electrolysis. While some studies have considered hydrogen as a power-to-power storage vector, it could also be used as a fuel across the energy system, for example for transport or heat generation. Here, two energy models are used to explore the potential contribution of P2G as a cost-effective source of hydrogen, particularly for future energy systems with high variable renewable energy (VRE) in which there are occasional periods when electricity supply exceeds demand. A detailed electricity system model is iterated with a multi-vector energy system model using a soft-linking approach. This iterative approach addresses shortcomings in each model to better understand the optimal capacity of P2G and the potential economic capture rate of excess VRE. The modelling method is applied to Great Britain in 2050 as a case study. A substantial proportion of excess VRE in 2050 can be captured by P2G, and it is economically competitive compared with alternative sources. Moreover, the effectiveness and economic viability of P2G for reducing excess renewable is robust at even very high levels of renewable penetration. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In this paper, the energy, exergy, economic, environmental, steady-state, and process performance modeling/analysis of hybrid renewable energy (RE) based multigeneration system is presented. Beyond the design/performance analysis of an innovative hybrid RE system, this study is novel as it proposes a new methodology for determining the overall process energy and exergy efficiency of multigeneration systems. This novel method integrates EnergPLAN simulation program with EES and Matlab. It considers both the steady-state and the process performance of the modeled system on hourly timesteps in order to determine the overall efficiencies. Based on the proposed new method, it is observed that the overall process thermodynamic efficiencies of a hybrid renewable energy-based multigeneration system are different from its steady-state efficiencies. The overall energy and exergy efficiencies reduce from 81.01% and 52.52% (in steady-state condition) to 58.6% and 39.33% (when considering a one-year process performance). The integration of the hot water production with the multigeneration system enhanced the overall thermodynamic efficiencies in steady-state conditions. The Kalina system produces a total work output of 1171 kW with a thermal and exergy efficiency of 12.23% and 52% respectively while the wind turbine system produces 1297 kW of electricity in steady-state condition and it has the same thermal/exergy efficiency (72%). The economic analysis showed that the Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the geothermal energy-based Kalina system is 0.0103 $/kWh. The greenhouse gas emission reduction analysis showed that the proposed system will save between 1,411,480 kg/yr and 3,518,760 kg/yr of greenhouse gases from being emitted into the atmosphere yearly. The multigeneration system designed in this study will produce electricity, hydrogen, hot water, cooling effect, and freshwater.

A solar-driven open Brayton cycle with intercooling, regeneration and reheat is coupled with a regenerative Rankine cycle and a Kalina cycle-11 as a unique series of power cycles. Significant portion of the produced electricity is utilized to produce green hydrogen in an electrolyzer. A thermal energy storage, a single-effect absorption refrigeration cycle and two domestic hot water heaters are also integrated. Energy, exergy and economic analyses are performed to examine the performance of the proposed system, and a detailed parametric analysis is conducted. Multiobjective optimization is carried out to determine the optimum performance. Optimum energy and exergy efficiencies, unit exergy product cost and total cost rate are calculated as 39.81%, 34.44%, 0.0798 $/kWh and 182.16 $/h, respectively.

Herein, nickel sulfide/CoFe layered double hydroxide heterostructures on nickel foam (NiS/LDH/NF) have been constructed by using hydrothermal and electro-deposition methods. The amorphous nickel sulfide is deposited on the surface of crystalline LDH mesh-like nanosheets to form a hierarchical flower-like structure. The deposition of amorphous NiS can control the morphology and modulate the electronic structure of NiS/LDH/NF. The obtained NiS/LDH/NF is employed as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, which can achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low voltage of 1.51 V in 1 M KOH. The results show that the high electrocatalytic activity is ascribed to the formation of amorphous NiS/crystalline LDH heterostructure with abundant surface defects and active sites.

	abstract = {Wind and solar energy are often expected to fall victim to their own success: the higher their share in electricity generation, the more their revenue in electricity markets (their “market value”) declines. While market values may converge to zero in conventional power systems, this study argues that “green” hydrogen production can effectively and permanently halt the decline by adding flexible electricity demand in low-price hours. To support this argument, this article further develops the merit order model and uses price duration curves to include flexible hydrogen electrolysis and to derive an analytical formula for the minimum market value of renewables in the long-term market equilibrium. This hydrogen-induced minimum market value is quantified for a wide range of parameters using Monte Carlo simulations and complemented with results from a more detailed numerical electricity market model. It is shown that—due to flexible hydrogen production alone—market values across Europe will likely stabilize above €19 ± 9 MWh−1 for solar energy and above €27 ± 8 MWh−1 for wind energy in 2050 (annual mean estimate ± standard deviation). This is in the range of the projected levelized cost of renewables, and other types of flexible electricity demand may further increase renewable market values. Market-based renewables may hence be within reach. © 2021 The Author},

	abstract = {Due to the environmental concerns caused by fossil fuels, renewable energy systems came into consideration. In this study, a renewable hybrid system based on ocean thermal, solar and wind energy sources were designed for power generation and hydrogen production. To analyze the system, a techno-economic model was exerted in order to calculate the exergy efficiency as well as the cost rate and the hydrogen production. The main parameters that affect the system performance were identified, and the impact of each parameter on the main outputs of the system was analyzed as well. The thermo-economic analysis showed that the most effective parameters on the exergy efficiency and total cost rate are the wind speed and solar collector area, respectively. To reach the optimum performance of the system, multi-objective optimization, by using genetic algorithm, was applied. The optimization was divided into two separate case studies; in case A, the cost rate and the exergy efficiency were considered as two objective functions; and in case B, the cost rate and the hydrogen production were assigned as two other objective functions. The optimization results of the case A showed that for the total cost rate of 30.5 $/h, the exergy efficiency could achieve 35.57%. While, the optimization of the case B showed that for the total cost rate of 28.06 $/h, the hydrogen production rate could reach 5.104 kg/h. Furthermore, after optimizing, an improvement in exergy efficiency was obtained, approximately 19%. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The aim of this study is to provide an integrated framework for identifying suitable areas for the construction of wind farms to produce hydrogen. For this purpose, a combined method of Geographic Information System (GIS) and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) has been used to locate the power plant in Yazd province. The GIS method in the present study consisted of two parts: constraints and criteria. The constraint section included areas that were unsuitable for the construction of wind farms to produce power and hydrogen. In the present study, various aspects such as physical, economic and environmental had been considered as constraints. In the criteria section, eight different criteria from technical aspects (including average wind speed, hydrogen production potential, land slope) and economic aspects (including distance to electricity grid, distance to urban areas, distance to road, distance to railway and distance to centers of High hydrogen consumption) had been investigated. The MCDM tool had been used to weigh the criteria and identify suitable areas. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique was used for weighting the criteria. The results of AHP weighting method showed that economic criteria had the highest importance with a value of 0.681. The most significant sub-criterion was the distance to urban areas and the least significant sub-criterion was the distance to power transmission lines. The results of GIS-MCDM analysis had shown that the most proper areas were in the southern and central sectors of Yazd province. In addition, the feasibility of hydrogen production from wind energy had shown that this province had the capacity to generate hydrogen at the rate of 53.6–128.6 tons per year. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Among the existing large-scale energy storage technologies, hydrogen storage has appeared as a powerful alternative due to its environmental benefits and the ability to store a large amount of energy for several hours to months. The major objective of the proposed research is to introduce a novel configuration of green hydrogen production for power generation during peak demand periods. In this regard, an innovative hybridization of a solar unit based on a parabolic trough collector with a proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer and a fuel cell is introduced and analyzed from the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic perspectives. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis and a multi-objective optimization based on the combination of neural network and grey wolf optimization algorithms are conducted to select the best working fluid of the solar unit and ideal operating conditions according to the minimum cost rate and the maximum exergy efficiency. The results indicate that Dowtherm™ A synthetic oil is the best working fluid, and the proposed system can generate 9, 14.9, and 20.1 MW of power during off-, mid-, and on-peak times, respectively.

	abstract = {Green hydrogen is viewed as a promising energy carrier for sustainable development goals. However, it has suffered from high costs hindering its implementation. For a stakeholder who considers both renewable energy and electrolysis units, it is important to exploit the flexibility of such portfolios to maximize system operational revenues. To this end, an electrolyser model that can characterize its dynamic behavior is required in both electric and thermal aspects. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive alkaline electrolyser model that is capable of describing its hydrogen production properties, temperature variations and state transitions (among production, stand-by and off states). This model is further used to study the optimal dispatch of an electrolyser based on a real-world hybrid wind/electrolyser system. The results show the model can effectively capture the coupling between thermal–electric dynamics and on–off performance of an electrolyser. The flexible operation strategy based on this model is proven to significantly increase daily revenues under different spot price conditions for electricity. Comparing the model with the ones derived from conventional modeling methods reveals this model offers more operating details and highlights several operational features, such as the preference for working at partial load conditions, although at the expense of more computing resources. It is suggested to use this model in studies related to energy integration, operation planning and control scheme development, in which the multi-domain dynamic properties of electrolysers in electricity/gas/heat need to be properly characterized. A sensitivity analysis on key parameters of such electrolyser system is also introduced to connect the daily operation with long-term planning. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the viability of different fuel cell types in a ship power system, where hydrogen and ammonia are considered as zero-carbon fuels. The identification of alternatives to diesel-powered ships is performed by taking into account the environmental and economic indicators of the considered power systems, determined by Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life-Cycle Cost Assessment (LCCA), and further compared with the existing diesel power systems of three passenger ships operating in Croatian coastal waters. Special attention is paid to fuel origin, where fossil fuels (grey fuel), fossil fuels followed by CO2 capture (blue fuel), and those produced from renewable energy sources (green fuel) are considered. The results of the research indicate that fuel cell systems with grey hydrogen and grey ammonia are not environmentally friendly, while fuel cell systems with the blue and green types of these fuels have a lower impact on the environment than a diesel-powered ship, with a reduction of up to 84% in CO2-eq emissions when green ammonia is used. Regarding profitability, the diesel-powered ship has the lowest total costs, while the second most cost-effective option is the fuel cell system with blue ammonia as fuel with 27%-43% higher costs than a diesel-powered ship, depending on which type of fuel cell is used. Although blue ammonia is a cheaper fuel than diesel fuel, the lifetime costs of the fuel cell power system are affected by relatively high investment costs (fuel cell, battery, cracker, etc.) and equipment replacement costs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study introduces a novel framework of an electricity and hydrogen supply system integrating with a photovoltaic power station for a residential area. The non-residential parts including the power grid and non-residential vehicles are added to ensure power balance and bring benefits, respectively. The optimal operational strategy of the proposed framework with considering uncertainties is proposed. The objective function minimizes the expected operational cost (EOC) by reducing the imported electricity from the power grid and increasing exported electricity/hydrogen to non-residential vehicles. Additionally, the demand response program (DRP) is applied in the residential load to achieve operational cost reduction. The uncertainties are modeled via various scenarios by using scenario-based stochastic optimization method. Notably, existing research for similar frameworks both lacks the consideration of uncertainties and DRP, and fails to distinguish the residential and non-residential vehicles with different charging behaviors. The results indicate that 1) The feasibility of the proposed framework is validated which can ensure the power balance of the residential area and reduce the operational cost. 2) The EOC is reduced when considering DRP. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {At present, as the demand for electricity increases in all sectors, there is an urgent need to introduce alternative renewable energy sources into modern energy systems. Renewable energy sources, which consist of solar (photovoltaic, PV), wind and hydro power, are key alternative sources of “green energy’’ energies, but it can also be used to produce “green” hydrogen. Thanks to scientific and technological progress, the cost of photovoltaic solar radiation converters is constantly decreasing at a high rate, which makes it possible to build solar power plants of sufficiently large capacity. In the coming decades, solar energy will become an incentive for the economic development of countries that have the maximum “solar” resource. The Republic of Tajikistan is one of these countries with a high potential for solar energy. The article presents an analysis of the resources and potential of solar energy in the Republic of Tajikistan. The study of electromagnetic transients in networks with photovoltaic solar power plants is performed. The main equations, simulation model and calculations of transients are presented, taking into account changes in voltage on DC buses. An algorithm for controlling the system of automatic control of output parameters is proposed. The analysis of dynamic and static modes in parallel operation of a solar power plant with the grid is carried out.

	abstract = {The temporal and geographical availability of renewable energy sources is highly variable, which imposes the importance of correct choices for energy storage and energy transport systems. This paper presents a smart strategy to utilize the natural gas distribution grid to transport and store the hydrogen. The goal is twofold: evaluating the capacity limits of the grid to accommodate “green hydrogen” for preset increasing shares of renewable energy sources (RESs) and determining at the same time the optimal mix of wind, photovoltaic (PV), biomethane and power-to-gas systems that minimizes the investment and operation costs. To this end, the energy supply system of an entire country is modelled and optimized considering the real characteristics and pressure levels of the gas grid, which is assumed to be the only storage mechanism of green hydrogen. The operational concept is to fill up the gas grid with hydrogen during the day and with natural gas during the night while always consuming the natural gas-hydrogen blend. Green hydrogen is generated by electrolysers powered by PVs, wind turbines and biomethane power systems. Results of the optimizations showed that: i) as long as the share of RES does not exceed 20%, there is no need to use the gas grid as RES storage system, ii) from 20 to 50% of RES share the gas grid receives the surplus of electricity in the peaks that would be necessary to “complete” the dispatchability of RES electricity, iii) above 50%, the excess of electricity in the peaks has to be used to generate the thermal energy required by the consumers. The gas grid can be used as unique renewable energy carrier and storage system up to 65% of RES share. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

The share of renewable energy is increasing worldwide, but due to the intermittent nature of wind and solar power, a lack of system flexibility is already hampering the further integration of renewable energy in some countries. In this study, we analyze if and how combinations of carbon pricing and power-to-gas (PtG) generation in the form of green power-to-hydrogen followed by methanation (which we refer to as PtG throughout) using captured CO2 emissions can provide transitions to deep decarbonization of energy systems. To this end, we focus on the economics of deep decarbonization of the European electricity system with the help of an energy system model. In different scenario analyses, we find that a CO2 price of 160 €/t (by 2050) is on its own not sufficient to decarbonize the electricity sector, but that a CO2 price path of 125 (by 2040) up to 160 €/t (by 2050), combined with PtG technologies, can lead to an economically feasible decarbonization of the European electricity system by 2050. These results are robust to higher than anticipated PtG costs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper suggested an optimal approach to design and operate a microgrid incorporating with battery energy storage, thermal energy storage, photovoltaic arrays, fuel cell, and boiler with minimization of the total operational cost of the hybrid microgrid. Two different hydrogen production methods are considered to assure the advantage of the developed proposed methodology. Furthermore, besides natural gas, residential and municipal wastes are collected and are utilized to produce electricity in fuel cell units. Load growth for different type of loads is also considered. The new number of households are added to the proposed system in different years and the proposed program is determined the optimum size of each employed resources to add each year for satisfying the total demand. To find out the optimum energy management and the optimum capacity of each employed distributed energy resources, a meta-heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm is utilized. It is concluded from the results that by utilizing residential waste, the amount of natural gas consumption by fuel cells is reduced about 6.2%, and by utilizing residential plus municipal waste, the reduction is about 26.7%. It is also observed that the amount of CO2 emission is reduced significantly (46.8%) in the case of utilization of produced heat by fuel cells.

	abstract = {When planning large-scale 100% renewable energy systems (RES) for the year 2050, the system capacity is usually oversized for better supply-demand matching of electrical energy since solar and wind resources are highly intermittent. This causes excessive excess energy that is typically dissipated, curtailed, or sold directly. The public literature shows a lack of studies on the feasibility of using this excess for country-scale co-generation. This study presents the first investigation of utilizing this excess to generate green hydrogen gas. The concept is demonstrated for Jordan using three solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and hybrid PV-wind RESs, all equipped with Lithium-Ion battery energy storage systems (ESSs), for hydrogen production using a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) system. The results show that the PV-based system has the highest demand-supply fraction (>99%). However, the wind-based system is more favorable economically, with installed RES, ESS, and PEM capacities of only 23.88 GW, 2542 GWh, and 20.66 GW. It also shows the highest hydrogen annual production rate (172.1 × 103 tons) and the lowest hydrogen cost (1.082 USD/kg). The three systems were a better option than selling excess energy directly, where they ensure annual incomes up to 2.68 billion USD while having payback periods of as low as 1.78 years. Furthermore, the hydrogen cost does not exceed 2.03 USD/kg, which is significantly lower than the expected cost of hydrogen (3 USD/kg) produced using energy from fossil fuel-based systems in 2050. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Using renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into methanol has gained extensive attention. This study focuses on a green methanol plant which contains both upstream green hydrogen-electricity production system and downstream CO2-based methanol synthesis. Three configurations were designed and optimized for the upstream off-grid hydrogen-electricity production system to obtain the minimum hydrogen cost. The optimization was conducted based on hourly meteorological data at Ordos, Inner Mongolia, China, as well as the hydrogen and electricity consumption by the downstream CO2 hydrogenation unit. On top of that, an integrative techno-economic analysis was conducted on the entire green methanol plant. Furthermore, the effect of key parameters and carbon tax on the economy of such green methanol plant was also explored. The results indicate that (1) for Ordos, the green methanol plant adopting photovoltaic-wind powered hydrogen production system (PV-Wind-H2-methanol) with oxygen selling has the lowest levelized cost of methanol, of which the upstream green hydrogen-electricity production system occupies 77%; (2) byproduct oxygen selling and CO2 source option has a significant effect on the methanol cost; (3) for PV-Wind-H2-methanol system, wind turbine cost is the most influential economic factor. To make the methanol cost of the PV-Wind-H2-methanol system to be lower than the conventional methanol cost, the cost of wind turbines and PV needs to be reduced by at least 50% at the same time; (4) if considering carbon tax, the PV-Wind-H2-methanol system will have potential to compete with conventional methanol plant. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing greenhouse gas emissions, as well as due to the rapidly increasing use of renewable energy sources in the electricity generation over the last years, interest in hydrogen is rising again. Hydrogen can be used as a storage for renewable energy balancing the whole energy systems, and contributing to the decarbonization of the energy system, especially of the industry and the transport sector. The major objective of this paper is to discuss various ways of hydrogen production depending on the primary energy sources used. Moreover, the economic and environmental performance of three major hydrogen colors, as well as major barriers for faster deployment in fuel cell vehicles, are analyzed. The major conclusion is that the full environmental benefits of hydrogen use are highly dependent on the hydrogen production methods and primary sources used. Only green hydrogen with electricity from wind, PV and hydro has truly low emissions. All other sources like blue hydrogen with CCUS or electrolysis using the electricity grid have substantially higher emissions, coming close to grey hydrogen production. Another conclusion is that it is important to introduce an international market for hydrogen to lower costs and to produce hydrogen where conditions are best. Finally, the major open question remaining is whether – including all external costs of all energy carriers, hydrogen of any color may become economically competitive in any sector of the energy system. The future success of hydrogen is very dependent on technological development and resulting cost reductions, as well as on future priorities and the corresponding policy framework. The policy framework should support the shift from grey to green hydrogen. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Electrolysis occupies a dominant position in the long-term application of hydrogen energy, as it can use the power surplus directly from renewable energies to produce hydrogen. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is a mature and reliable technology standing out from other types of electrolysis because of its simplicity and low cost. Several multiphysics processes inside the AWE cell, such as the electrochemical, thermal, and fluidic processes. Developing the multiphysics model to quantify the relationship between these physics fields is essential for cell design. This paper establishes a three-dimensional numerical model to consider the quantitative relationship between the electrochemical process and fluidic process inside the cell of industrial AWE. The model considers the structural design of industrial AWE equipment, revealing that the shunting current effect introduced by the structure design cannot be ignored in the model. The simulation results present that the multiphysics model considering the bubble effect can estimate the current–voltage (I-V) characteristic curve more accurately with a relative error smaller than 5%, especially at a current density higher than 2500 A/m2. The model established is supposed to advance the development of water electrolysis models and guide the electrolyzer design of industrial AWE cell. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The South Korean government promotes hydrogen-powered vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but these vehicles use gray hydrogen while charging, which causes GHG emissions. Therefore, converting this fuel into green hydrogen is necessary to help reduce GHG emissions, which will incur investment costs of approximately USD 20 billion over a decade. In this study, a contingent valuation method is applied in an analysis to examine the extent to which consumers are willing to pay for green hydrogen charging compared to gray hydrogen charging. The results indicate that the monthly mean of willingness to pay per driver is 51,674 KRW (USD 45.85), equivalent to 4302 KRW per kg (USD 3.82). Additionally, consumers accept a 28.5% increase in the monthly average fuel expenses when converting to green hydrogen. These findings can be used in the development of pricing and energy use plans to finance the expansion of green hydrogen infrastructure. © 2022},

	abstract = {The energy crisis globally has severely damaged the economy of the globe which forces researchers and scientists to provide a new promising technology. Also, the rapid depletion of fossil fuels leads to an energy crisis & environmental concern, because of this, economic stress is created for the people of the world. To overcome these, water splitting is sustainable and renewable energy, but it requires active electrocatalysts. The nanostructure material morphology characterization was investigated by the, XRD, EDS, SEM, HRTEM, EELS chemical composition maps through & XPS which properly reveal the nanocomposite materials morphology strongly aggregates. The materials exhibit outstanding OER response as compared to Co3O4 & manganese sulfide due to the synergetic effect produced in the composite materials including fast charge transport from MoSOX, active sites & high density of Co3O4, which accelerates the OER kinetics. Between the composites, Co3O4-MoSOX with the greatest amount of Co3O4 (S4 0.7g) content owns the lower overpotential to produce OER kinetics & having a 60 mV dec−1 and Tafel slope of as compared to other material. Further, for the exchange of current density of 2.97 × 10−3A/cm2 & it is extremely durable for 45 h. The EIS ensure the fast charge transport for the extra addition of pristine S4 (0.7g) in the composite, which potentially enhanced the production of the OER kinetics activity. In this regard transition metal oxide especially, Co3O4 is promising material, but it requires certain strategies to improve its catalytic kinetics activity & stability for the full water splitting. Keeping these challenges, the proposed study is of great concern to economical and societal needs, which can lead to a boost in the electrochemical applications in particular oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Therefore, rapid efforts must be made to realize the nonprecious catalysts for water splitting and equality compete with the world in the hydrogen/electron economy. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Electrolysis of seawater gets an attention to produce hydrogen for renewable energy technology. It significantly reduces the use of fresh water instead of seawater. Development of low temperature fabrication of electrocatalyst can explore seawater splitting by avoiding chloride reduction during the hydrogen production. In the present work, we fabricated low temperature hydrothermal growth of Cu2S electrocatalyst on Ni foam at constant temperature of 80 °C at different growth times of 1–3 h. The prepared Cu2S electrocatalyst grown for 1 h exhibited low overpotentials of 76 and 118 mV at 10 mA/cm2 (289 and 358 mV overpotentials at 100 mA/cm2) in 1 M KOH deionized water and seawater, respectively for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Tafel plot of Cu2S catalyst grown for 1 h showed lesser Tafel slope value of 128 mVdec−1 than that of other growth times 2 h (136 mVdec−1) and 3 h (142 mV dec−1) indicating elevated electrocatalytic behaviour of Cu2S grown for 1 h. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed charge transfer resistance of 12.8Ω, 19.6 Ω and 25.7Ω, for Cu2S grown for 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively, this lower charge transfer resistance indicated higher charge transfer properties. The Cu2S electrocatalyst grown for 1 h sustained retention of 80% after 12 h continuous stability test. Therefore, the cost-effective and low temperature fabrication of Cu2S electrocatalyst proceeds for development of largescale seawater splitting for hydrogen production. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Distributed generation, based on the exploitation of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), has increased in the last few decades to limit anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, and this trend will increase in the future. However, RES generation is not dispatchable, and an increasing share of RES may lead to inefficiencies and even problems for the electricity network. Flexible resources are needed to handle RES generation in order to support the delicate electricity generation and demand balance. Energy conversion technologies (P2X, Power to X) allow the flexibility of energy systems to be increased. These technologies make a connection between different energy sectors (e.g., electricity and gas) possible, and thus create new synergies within an overall multi-energy system. This paper analyzes how the P2G technology can be used at the distribution network level (both gas and electricity) to optimize the use of RES. In fact, in order to coordinate P2X resources, it is necessary to take into account the whole multi-energy scenario, and not just the electrical side: it therefore becomes fundamental to recognize the pros and cons that Balancing Service Providers (BSPs), composed of a number of P2G plants (representing the Balancing Responsible Providers, BRPs), may have when offering services to an electricity network. Moreover, the convenience of the decarbonization of the gas grid has been evaluated through the calculation of the levelized cost of Synthetic Natural Gas (LCSNG) for cost scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050, considering different assumptions about the cost of the surplus utilization of RES. The results show that LCSNG may vary from 47 to 319 €/MWh, according to the different configurations, i.e., only in the best-case scenario is the SNG cost comparable with the cost of natural gas, and hence does the P2G technology result to be profitable. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the past decades, H2 has attracted significant attention as a potentially low, zero, or negative-emissions fuel depending on how it is produced. However, how H2 will evolve in terms of its production, demand, and transport is not very clear. To help fill this gap, we developed a Python-based tool called the Hydrogen Economy Assessment & Resource Tool (HEART), specifically focused on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. The tool consists of three parts: a user-friendly GUI, a default database consisting of costs and emissions for various supply/demand pathways, and an analysis and optimization engine. Users can use the default data and/or user inputs to run case studies for insightful results. The analysis and optimization engine can carry out techno-enviro-economic analysis for H2 production and H2 transport, project H2 demand, and carry out the optimization and planning of H2 supply chain over a long-term period. In this paper, we introduce the framework of HEART, the workflow of various projects, and show the capabilities and strengths of HEART through a case study. The case study indicates the tool can provides many useful results, like the landed cost and carbon footprint of H2. Most importantly, by using HEART, H2 supply chain pathways to meet projected demand can be obtained and optimized for total cost or total emissions. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Such a system has been conceived as a profitable ready-made solution to be embedded into existing plants already equipped with renewable energy sources (i.e., wind farm and photovoltaic panels) by means of a reversible solid oxide cell and energy storage technologies. A dynamic programming-based routine has been suitably implemented as an algorithm for both the electrical and thermal sides of the plant for managing the power split indices. In addition, an external routine has been deployed to consider economic aspects; in particular, attention has been paid to the levelized cost of energy, allowing for comparisons with current reliable energy generation technologies. The analyses involve parametric assessments of multiple reversible solid oxide cell sizes and economic discount rates while fixing the lifetime of the plant at 30 years. In accordance with the results of the optimal microgrid design, by exploiting 100% of the rSOC working time (shared by mode as 40% fuel cell and 60% electrolyzer) a simple payback period of 5.97 years is achieved along with a levelized cost of energy index value in the 0.1 €/kWh-0.2 €/kWh range. © 2022},

The studied model is comprised of photovoltaic modules and a fuel cell that serves as the energy storage unit. The study was conducted in 2020, utilizing real-time weather and electrical load data with a one-minute temporal resolution. The daily average energy consumption for the analyzed household was 10.1 kWh, with a peak power output of 5.3 kW, and the yearly energy consumption was 3755 kWh. The investigated photovoltaic system has a capacity of 2.7 kWp (6 modules at 0.45 kWp/module), and the fuel cell capacity is in the range of 0–3 kW in order to obtain optimal integration with the photovoltaic system to get maximum renewable energy fraction utilization. The findings indicate that using fuel cells powered by hydrogen generated by renewable energy systems can significantly increase self-consumption and self-sufficiency. The annual results showed that the use of 2.5 kW fuel cells can increase renewable fraction utilization from 0.622 to 0.918 with a 2.5 kW fuel cell, and energy self-consumption can reach 3338.2 kWh/year, an increase of 98.4%, and energy self-sufficiency can reach 3218.8 kWh/year, an increase of 94.41%.

In order to serve this purpose, this study focuses on the simulation of the installation of an on-grid photovoltaic (PV) power system at the Vocational Colleges Campus, Hitit University. On the other hand, the integration of the simulated PV system with a gas fired-trigeneration system is discussed. Moreover, the study explores opportunities for solar hydrogen generation without energy storage on campus. For the PV system simulation, three different scenarios were created by using web-based PV system design software (HelioScope). Installed powers in the simulation were found as 94.2 kWe, 123.9 kWe, and 157.5 kWe for the low scenario (on the rooftop), high scenario (on the rooftop), and the high + PV canopy arrays scenario (on the rooftop and an outdoor parking area), respectively. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) values were 0.061 $/kWh, 0.065 $/kWh, and 0.063 $/kWh for the low scenario, high scenario, and the scenario including PV canopy, respectively. The energy payback time is found to be 6.47–6.94 years for the 20–25 years lifetime of the PV plant. The simulation results showed that the PV system could support it by generating additional electrical energy up to 25% of the existing system. The campus can reduce GHG emissions of 1546–2272 tonnes-CO2eq, which is equivalent to 142–209 ha of forest-absorbing carbon unused during the life of the PV system. Depending on the production and consumption methods utilized on campus, which is a location with relatively large solar potential, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of hydrogen generation ranged from 0.054 $/kWhH2 (1.78 $/kgH2) to 0.103 $/kWhH2 (3.4 $/kgH2).

	abstract = {For the first time, we quantify cost, footprint, and reliability implications of deploying hydrogen-based generation in off-grid electric vehicle charging stations (CS) using an optimization model coupled with a geographic information system (GIS) analysis for the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. We also account for the challenges associated with wind energy deployment as a candidate generation technology within city centers. The analysis was restricted to carbon-free technologies: photovoltaics (PV), wind, battery, and hydrogen fuel-cells. At current prevailing technology costs, hydrogen can reduce the required footprint of off-grid CSs by 25% at a small incremental cost increase without impacting the charging reliability. By 2030, however, hydrogen will simultaneously provide the footprint and cost advantages. If we allow as little as 5% of the annual load to be unmet, the required footprint of the CS decreases by 60%. The levelized cost of energy values for the CS by 2030 can range between 0.13 and 0.20 $/kWh depending on learning-curve assumptions. The footprints calculated are then mapped to five land parcel categories in Riyadh: gas station, hospital, mall, school, and university. Incorporating hydrogen in CS design increases the number of parcels that could accommodate CSs by 15–45% via reducing the required PV array (i.e., footprint). © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Nowadays, large numbers of renewable energy generators have been installed world-widely to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrogen-based storage system has the largest energy density, which is with a great potential suitable to address the intermittence of these renewable energy outputs. In addition, the HVDC (high voltage direct current) transmission is often deployed to transmit the remote located abundant renewable energy resources to terminal consumers due to its lower losses. However, building a low-carbon emission power system through hydrogen-based microgrid clusters and the HVDC transmission still lacks investigations thus is an essential problem. In this paper, a probabilistic sizing methodology considering the uncertainties is developed. First, both the hydrogen-based storage system model and the HVDC model are analytically modeled. Second, a mixed integer programming optimal strategy is deployed to operate the hydrogen-based microgrid. Third, operation model of the renewable energy power station-HVDC transmission-IEEE 30 nodes network-microgrid clusters are presented. Last, the best sizing value for each component is obtained by a genetic algorithm. In addition, the uncertainties of the data profiles are modeled using scenario method. Within different scenarios, the probability density function of each sizing component is calculated. The results demonstrate that the sizing values based on the probabilistic method can reduce the adverse impacts of the uncertainties on the utility grids. Specifically, the mean value of the utility grid operation cost is reduced by 0.005 %-0.08 %. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in power systems increase all over the world to overcome current challenges, most importantly environmental issues. Beside advantages of RESs, their integration into the power systems have imposed various challenges considering uncertain and intermitted power output. To cope with these challenges, utilizing energy storage systems with renewable energy sources alongside the demand response (DR) programs are considered as reliable solutions. On the other hand, in an uncertain environment, minimizing worst-case cost or regret is counted as an important criterion to evaluate operation of any system under uncertain parameters. Therefore, in this paper, optimal operation of power systems is solved under penetration of wind turbines, hydrogen storage system, and DR programs in an uncertain environment. To guarantee robust operation of the system under the worst-case scenario, a novel stochastic p-robust optimization method (SPROM) is proposed which combines both stochastic programming and robust optimization approaches where minimizes the worst-case cost or regret level. The performance of the developed model is evaluated considering a six-bus test system under two cases as stochastic optimization (SO) and SPROM. Obtained results show that the maximum regret level is reduced considerably using the proposed SPROM comparing with pure stochastic method. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

For one thing, the power system's stability is challenged by the increasing penetration of variable renewable energies, especially wind power, due to its fluctuation and intermittency.

This paper proposes a new energy system that integrates the hydrogen production and distribution system to the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system with significant wind power to solve these two challenges simultaneously. The new energy system can meet the energy needs of the building. At the same time, the wind power utilization rate reaches 92.6%, and the typical daily hydrogen production capacity in winter, transition season and summer is 500 kg, 500 kg and 266 kg, respectively.

In this paper, a security-constrained multi-period optimal power flow (SC-MPOPF) model is developed aiming to determine the optimal hourly dispatch of generators as well as power to hydrogen (P2H) units in the presence of large-scale renewable energy sources (RES). The proposed model characterizes the P2H demand flexibility in the proposed SC-MPOPF model, taking into account the electrolyzer behavior, reactive power support of P2H demands and hydrogen storage capability.

	abstract = {Efficient energy production and consumption are fundamental points for reducing carbon emissions that influence climate change. Alternative resources, such as renewable energy sources (RESs), used in electricity grids, could reduce the environmental impact. Since RESs are inherently unreliable, during the last decades the scientific community addressed research efforts to their integration with the main grid by means of properly designed energy storage systems (ESSs). In order to highlight the best performance from these hybrid systems, proper design and operations are essential. The purpose of this paper is to present a so-called model predictive controller (MPC) for the optimal operations of grid-connected wind farms with hydrogen-based ESSs and local loads. Such MPC has been designed to take into account the operating and economical costs of the ESS, the local load demand and the participation to the electricity market, and further it enforces the fulfillment of the physical and the system's dynamics constraints. The dynamics of the hydrogen-based ESS have been modeled by means of the mixed-logic dynamic (MLD) framework in order to capture different behaviors according to the possible operating modes. The purpose is to provide a controller able to cope both with all the main physical and operating constraints of a hydrogen-based storage system, including the switching among different modes such as ON, OFF, STAND-BY and, at the same time, reduce the management costs and increase the equipment lifesaving. The case study for this paper is a plant under development in the north Norway. Numerical analysis on the related plant data shows the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, which manages the plant and commits the equipment so as to preserve the given constraints and save them from unnecessary commutation cycles. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Green ammonia, synthesized from air, water, and renewable energy, is a carbon-free energy storage vector with numerous potential energy applications, including dispatchable green electricity for the power sector. Due to the low cost of storing and transporting ammonia, green ammonia can be available as an energy source in all geographies, without the geological storage requirements of carbon capture and storage (CCS) or underground hydrogen storage. Here we contribute a novel techno-economic analysis to forecast the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from ammonia based on near-term and long-term technological developments to 2040, thus filling the knowledge gap for the application of ammonia as an energy vector in the electricity sector. We find that green ammonia could be available in many locations for less than 400 USD/t in 2040 with potential to be reduced to below 300 USD/t if electrolyzers achieve optimistic cost reductions, or when more favorable renewable resources are used to supply a global green ammonia market. We model ammonia-to-power via combustion in combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT) as a promising route to low-cost, dispatchable electricity generation. At power plant capacity factors below 25%, which may be increasingly common in electricity sectors with high variable renewable electricity, a tipping point occurs around 400 USD/t ammonia fuel price to enable green ammonia to compete with other prominent forms of dispatchable, low or zero-carbon technologies, such as gas, bio-energy, or coal fired power plants with post-combustion CCS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

In renewable hybrid power systems containing fuel cells and batteries, the hydrogen consumption reduction and battery state of charge (SOC) utilizing are the main objectives. These parameters are essential to get the maximum befits of cost reduction as well as battery and hydrogen storage lifetime increasing. In this paper, a novel hybrid energy management system (HEMS) was designed to achieve these objectives. A renewable hybrid power system combines: PV, PEMFC, SC, and Battery was designed to supply a predetermined load with its needed power. This (REHPS) depends on the PV power as a master source during the daylight. It uses the FC to support as a secondary source in the night or shading time. The battery is helping the FC when the load power is high. The supercapacitor (SC) is working at the load transient or load fast change. The proposed energy management system uses fuzzy logic and frequency decoupling and state machine control strategies working together as a hybrid strategy where the switching over between both strategies done automatically based on predetermined values to obtain the minimum value of hydrogen consumption and the maximum value of SOC at the same time. The proposed HEMS achieves 19.6% Hydrogen consumption saving and 5.4% increase in SOC value compared to the results of the same two strategies when working as a stand-alone. The load is designed to show a surplus power when the PV power is at its maximum value. This surplus power is used to charge the battery. To validate the system, the results were compared with the results of each strategy if working separately. The comparison confirms the achievement of the hybrid energy management system goal. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

By comparing a scenario in which a renewable hydrogen quota with tradable certificates is imposed on final gas consumption in the sectors of the economy outside the EU emissions trading system with a reference scenario without a quota, we assess price, quantity and welfare effects. Our model simulations show that the hydrogen quota leads to a significant expansion in renewable electricity generating capacity to produce renewable hydrogen and synthetic methane with power-to-gas technologies. On the electricity market, the price increases substantially, rising by up to 12% – mostly due to increasing emission allowance prices – leading to a higher surplus for power producers. The quota's primary beneficiaries in the power sector are renewable energy producers. On the gas market, the quota leads to a small decrease in prices (by a maximum of -3%) and gas producer surpluses. Quota obliged gas consumers, mainly households, commercial and small industrial consumers, carry the largest part of the burden associated with the obligation. Overall, the quota leads to the redistribution of welfare from these consumers to renewable electricity generators and power-to-gas producers and a significant decline in total welfare. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

In this study, the CO2 methanation process, which yields synthetic natural gas (SNG) via the synthesis of CO2 and H2 through proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis using surplus electricity generated from renewable energy, was evaluated and optimized based on techno-economic analyses. Requirements for the introduction of SNG produced through CO2 methanation in domestic natural gas markets are presented by considering various scenarios. Results indicate that, even if the electricity costs, including system marginal price and renewable energy costs, are minimal, the costs for PEM water electrolysis and CO2 methanation must be reduced by ~$550/kW and 25%, respectively, relative to current levels for the viable introduction of SNG in domestic markets. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

A time-of-use grid penalty cost model evaluating grid import and export during on-peak and off-peak periods is proposed to achieve the power grid flexibility and economy. Multi-objective optimizations are conducted to size zero-energy buildings and the community considering the renewable energy self-consumption, on-site load coverage and grid penalty cost in the coupled platform of TRNSYS and jEplus+EA. The study results indicate that battery storage improves the renewable energy self-consumption, load coverage, hydrogen system efficiency and grid integration of the zero-energy community. Grid penalty cost reductions of 145.36% − 158.92% and 135.05% − 164.41% are achieved in zero-energy scenarios with and without battery storage compared with baseline scenarios without renewable energy. The lifetime net present value of four zero-energy scenarios with battery storage is increased by 22.39% − 96.17% compared with baseline scenarios, while it is reduced by 6.45% of US$ 7.62M and 1.90% of US$ 2.16M in zero-energy campus and residential buildings without battery storage. Substantial environmental benefits are also achieved in zero-energy scenarios with and without battery storage for reducing carbon emissions by 71.23% − 90.93% and 67.57% − 91.36%, respectively.

	abstract = {Green hydrogen production can only be realized via water electrolysis using renewable energy sources. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers have been demonstrated as the technology of choice for mass production of green hydrogen due to their scalability and potential high efficiency. However, the technology is still relatively expensive due to the catalyst materials cost and operational limitations due to mass transfer and activation polarizations. During the oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen bubbles stick to the electrode surface and this causes a low reaction rate and high mass transfer losses. In this study, the commonly used electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reactions; IrO2, is modified by introducing magnetic Fe3O4 to achieve greater bubble separation at the anode during operation. The prepared composite catalysts were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope, Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis, X-Ray Powder Diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller characterization methods. The modified composite electrocatalyst samples are magnetized to investigate the magnetic field effect on oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. 90% IrO2 - 10% Fe3O4 and 80% IrO2 - 20% Fe3O4 samples are tested via linear sweep voltammetry both ex-situ and in-situ in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer single cell. According to the linear sweep voltammetry tests, the magnetization of the 80% IrO2 - 20% Fe3O4 sample resulted in 15% increase in the maximum current density. Moreover, the single cell electrolyzer test showed a four-fold increase in current density by employing the magnetized 80% IrO2 - 20% Fe3O4 catalyst. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Variable renewable energy sources (VRES) will be the cornerstones of future energy supply systems. Nevertheless, their inherent intermittency remains an obstacle to their widespread deployment. Renewably-produced or ‘green’ hydrogen has been suggested as an energy carrier that could account for this in a sustainable manner. In this study, a fully VRES-based European energy system in the year 2050 is designed using an iterative minimal cost-optimization approach that ensures robust supply security across 38 weather-year scenarios (1980–2017). The impact of different power generation locations is factored in by defining exclusive VRES groups within each optimization region. From this, it can be seen that higher numbers of groups in each region offer cheaper electricity generation locations to the optimizer and thus decrease the system's total annual costs. Furthermore, the robust system design and impact of inter-annual variability is identified by iteratively combining the installed capacities of different system designs derived through the application of the 38 historical weather years. The system design outlined here has significantly lower capacities in comparison to the maximum regional capacities obtained in the first round of optimization. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The high production of sugarcane in Brazil and its application of ethanol and sugar production results in a higher generation of vinasse and bagasse. The treatment of these residues can be carried out using anaerobic co-digestion procedures. Besides promoting waste treatment, it enables energy exploration through biogas and hydrogen generation. Bioenergy use can also generate steam in sugar and alcohol plants by burning, sugarcane milling, fueling vehicles for the transport of products, among others. These energy applications allow total and efficient, energetic exploring of sugarcane. Hence, this study estimated the production of methane, hydrogen, thermal and electrical energy generated from vinasse and bagasse in the autonomous and annexed Brazilian ethanol and sugar plants. Three scenarios present the use of biogas generated: Scenario 1: energy use of all methane from biogas; Scenario 2: hydrogen production from the remaining methane, after considering the energy autonomy of the ethanol plants; Scenario 3: hydrogen production from all the methane generated. All the scenarios which considered the use of methane led to energy self-sufficiency in the sector. However, only annexed plants present economic feasibility for implementing the project. Scenario 2 is highlighted in this study, once beyond the sector's energetic self-sufficiency, the operational conditions enabled the storage of 9.26E+07 Nm3.d−1 of hydrogen, equal 3.04E+08 ton per year. CH4 and H2 production seen in a global scenario of circular economy and energy security have high benefits, contributing to the gradual transformation of an economy dependent on non-renewable resources into a circular and renewable economy. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Power-to-gas is an emerging energy conversion technology. When integrating power-to-gas into the combined cooling, heating and power system, renewable generations can be further accommodated to synthesize natural gas, and additional revenues can be obtained by reutilizing and selling the synthesized gas. Therefore, it is necessary to address the optimal operation issue of the integrated system (Combined cooling, heating and power-Power-to-gas) for bringing the potential benefits, and thus promoting energy transition. This paper proposes a Wasserstein and multivariate linear affine based distributionally robust optimization model for the above issue considering multiple uncertainties. Specifically, the uncertain distribution of wind power and electric, thermal, cooling loads is modeled as an ambiguity set by applying the Wasserstein metric. Then, based on the ambiguity set, the proposed model with two-stage structure is established. In the first-stage, system operation cost (involving the energy exchange and carbon emission costs, etc.) is minimized under the forecast information. In the second stage, for resisting the interference of multiple uncertainties, the multivariate linear affine policy models are constructed for operation rescheduling under the worst-case distribution within the ambiguity set, which is capable of adjusting flexible resources according to various random factors simultaneously. Simulations are implemented and verify that: 1) both the economic and environmental benefits of system operation are improved by integrating power-to-gas; 2) the proposed model keeps both the conservativeness and computational complexity at low levels, and its solutions enable the effective system operation in terms of cost saving, emission reduction, uncertainty resistance and renewable energy accommodation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to the extensive use of fossil fuels & their direct influence on the environment, new ways of producing energy sources are highly needed. Hydrogen is the perfect candidate for renewable energy; however, H2 gas production is associated with disadvantages due to a lack of efficient and active catalysts that could be cost-effective and comparable to platinum performance. Active hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts are needed to advance the development of a cheaper generation of solar fuels. Thus, outperformance, and stable earth abundant. And inexpensive catalysts are highly demanded. That is H2 gas production from the electrolysis of water through HER. In this work, we present different analytical techniques that characterize an efficient and highly stable catalyst based on transition metal oxide Co3O4/MoS2 nanostructures. And their composites for water splitting in harsh acidic conditions time and material chemical composition as like SEM, EDS, XRD, HRTEM & XPS. The composite material is highly best to produce HER at 10 mA cm−2 and obtained 268 mV overpotential of nano Co3O4/MoS2 (S3) and Tafel slope of 56 mv/dec. Faraday efficiencies of the hydrogen gas production measured for the 60 min and catalyst is highly durable for the 20 h. The presented catalysts are up to the mark of platinum metal performance and superior to several transition metal oxides. This fabrication technology is a new roadmap for developing active and scalable hydrogen-evolving catalysts by overcoming the issues of fewer catalytic edges, low density, and poor conductivity. © 2021},

	abstract = {The global climate and environmental crisis dictate the need for the development and implementation of environmentally friendly and efficient technical solutions, for example, generation based on renewable energy sources. However, the annually increasing demand for electricity (according to the forecasts of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the amount of energy consumed for the period 2006–2030 will increase by 44 %) cannot be fully provided by alternative energy. The main reason is not so much the high cost of these technologies, like unstable power generation, which determines the need for an additional reserve of regulated power. The solution to this problem can be the combined use of generation based on renewable energy sources with energy storage units of large capacity. Currently, a promising direction is the use of excess electricity for the production of hydrogen and its further accumulation in hydrogen storage. In this case an additional energy can be generated using industrial fuel cells (electrochemical generators) to compensate for the power shortage. At the same time, the distinctive advantage of hydrogen energy storage systems lies in the ability to accumulate a large amount of energy for long periods of time. This fact makes it possible to increase the reliability of the functioning of the electric power system, to provide power supply with a sufficiently long interruption (in case of faults) or allocation for isolated operation. With an increase in the unit capacity and the share of renewable generation in the total installed capacity, researches that aimed to systematic analysis of the impact of the implemented generation unit and the energy storage system on the parameters of the mode of the electric power system become more relevant. There are a number of tasks can be noted related to determining the optimal location and size of the generation unit and energy storage systems being implemented in terms of reducing power losses and maintaining an appropriate voltage level in the nodes of the electric power system. In this article, a variant of solving the optimization task for a typical 15-bus IEEE scheme is presented by means of software calculation using the bubble sorting method. To achieve this goal, the following tasks were solved: the objective function, which indicates the optimal location and size of the generation unit, and constraints, for example, the available deviation of voltage level, were formed; the software implementation of the algorithm for calculating power flows and power losses using the bubble sorting method was carried out. The results of the work of the program code for two scenarios are presented: for instance, installation of one renewable generation unit with a different range of possible capacities, and are compared with the data obtained in the MATLAB/Simulink software package. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Hydrogen is generated by electrolysers located at each existing Irish wind farm using curtailed or available wind electricity. Additional electricity is supplied by on-site photovoltaic (PV) arrays and stored using lithium-ion batteries. At each wind farm, sizing of the electrolyser, PV array and battery is optimised system design to obtain the minimum levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Results show the average electrolyser capacity factor is 64% after the integration of wind farm-based electrolysers with PV arrays and batteries. A location-allocation algorithm in a geographic information system (GIS) environment optimises the distributed hydrogen supply chain from each wind farm to a hypothetical hydrogen refuelling station in the nearest city. Results show that hydrogen produced, transported, and dispensed using this system can meet the entire current bus fuel demand for all the studied cities, at a potential LCOH of 5–10 €/kg by using available wind electricity. At this LCOH, the future operational cost of FCEBs in Belfast, Cork and Dublin can be competitive with public buses fuelled by diesel, especially under carbon taxes more reflective of the environmental impact of fossil fuels. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Biomass can be converted into a range of different end-products; and when combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS), these processes can provide negative CO2 emissions. Biomass conversion technologies differ in terms of costs, system efficiency and system value, e.g. services provided, market demand and product price. The aim of this study is to comparatively assess a combination of BECCS pathways to identify the applications which offer the most valuable outcome, i.e. maximum CO2 removal at minimum cost, ensuring that resources of sustainable biomass are utilised efficiently. Three bioenergy conversion pathways are evaluated in this study: (i) pulverised biomass-fired power plants which generate electricity (BECCS), (ii) biomass-fuelled combined heat and power plants (BE-CHP-CCS) which provide both heat and electricity, and (iii) biomass-derived hydrogen production with CCS (BHCCS). The design and optimisation of the BECCS supply chain network is evaluated using the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technology framework for the UK (MONET-UK), which integrates biogeophysical constraints and a wide range of biomass feedstocks. The results show that indigenous sources of biomass in the UK can remove up to 56 MtCO/yr from the atmosphere without the need to import biomass. Regardless of the pathway, Bio-CCS deployment could materially contribute towards meeting a national CO2 removal target and provide a substantial contribution to a national-scale energy system. Finally, it was more cost-effective to deploy all three technologies (BECCS, BE-CHP-CCS and BHCCS) in combination rather than individually. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Carbon-free hydrogen can be provided by water-electrolysis from renewable energies. In this study we introduce an approach to assess the potential of wind-based hydrogen for use in adjacent regional rail transport by applying a GIS approach in conjunction with a site-level cost model. In Brandenburg about 10.1 million train-km annually could be switched to fuel cell electric train operation. This relates to a diesel consumption of appr. 9.5 million liters today. If fuel cell trains would be employed, that translated to 2198 annual tons hydrogen annually. At favorable sites hydrogen costs of approx. 6.40 €/kg - including costs of hydrogen refueling stations - could be achieved. Making excess hydrogen available for other consumers, would further decrease hydrogen production costs. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Integrating sector coupling technologies into Hydrogen (H2) based hybrid renewable energy systems (HRES) is becoming a promising way to create energy prosumers, despite the very little research work being done in this largely unexplored field. In this paper, a sector coupling strategy (building and transportation) is developed and applied to a grid-connected PV/battery/H2 HRES, to maximise self-sufficiency for a University campus and to produce power and H2 for driving electric tram in Ouargla, Algeria. A multi-objective size optimization problem is solved as a single objective problem using the ε-constraint method, in which the cost of energy (COE) is defined as the main objective function to be minimized, while both loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and non-renewable usage (NRU) are defined as constraints. Particle swarm optimization and HOMER software are then employed for simulation and optimization purposes. Prior to the two scenarios investigated, a sensitivity study is performed to determine the effects of H2 demand by tram and NRU on the techno-economic feasibility of the proposed system, followed by a new reliability factor introduced in the optimization, namely loss of H2 supply probability (LHSP). The results of the first scenario show that by setting NRUmax = 100%, the system without H2 provides the best solution with COE of 0.016 $/kWh that reaches grid parity and has 13% NRU. However, by setting NRUmax = 1% in the second scenario, an optimized configuration consisting of grid/PV/Electrolyzer/Fuel cell/Storage tank is obtained, which has 0% NRU and COE of 0.1 $/kWh. In the second scenario, it is also observed that an increased number of trams (i.e. increased H2 demands) causes a significant reduction in LHSP, COE, NRU and CO2 emissions. It is thus concluded that the grid/PV combination is the optimal choice for the studied system when considering economic aspects. However, taking into account the growing requirements of future energy systems, grid-connected PV with H2 will be the best solution. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The framework of this study is to weight 8 selected determinants and rank energy alternatives for hydrogen investments. For this purpose, different criteria that are based on two dimensions are identified with supported literature and interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) with alpha cuts is considered to measure the significant criteria. Additionally, renewable and non-renewable energy alternatives are ranked regarding the appropriateness for hydrogen energy investments with the help of IT2 fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and IT2 fuzzy Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) with alpha cuts. It is concluded that the weights of the criteria are quite similar for different alpha cuts. Also, ranking results of different energy alternatives are almost the same for both IT2 fuzzy TOPSIS and IT2 fuzzy VIKOR. Thus, it can be concluded that the analysis results are reliable and coherent. The principal results indicate that cost-efficiency and reserve adequacy play a key role in hydrogen investments since they have the highest weight (0.129). Moreover, it is also found that technological capacity also plays a critical role in this regard with the weight of 0.127. However, legal regulation has the lowest importance weight (0.121) in comparison with other factors. Additionally, the weights of personnel competency (criterion 3) and storage (criterion 4) are also low (0.122). The major conclusion show that renewable energy alternatives are more suitable to generate hydrogen energy in comparison with non-renewable ones. Within this context, it is identified that solar and geothermal energies are more appropriate alternatives for hydrogen production whereas coal and nuclear are on the last rank. Hence, the main strategy should be lowering the costs by following up-to-date technological developments. Another important issue is that it becomes more logical to produce hydrogen in renewable energy sources that will not be consumed forever so that sustainable production of the hydrogen can be provided. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper describes the size optimization of a hybrid photovoltaic/fuel cell grid linked power system including hydrogen storage. The overall objective is the optimal sizing of a hybrid power system to satisfy the load demand of a university laboratory with an unreliable grid, with low energy cost and minimal carbon emissions. The aim is to shift from grid linked diesel power system to a clean and sustainable energy system. The optimum design architecture was established by adopting the energy-balance methods of HOMER (hybrid optimization model for electric renewables). Analysis of hourly simulations was performed to decide the optimal size, cost and performance of the hybrid system, using 22-years monthly averaged solar radiation data collected for Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma (Lat. 6°44.3ʹN, Long. 6°4.8ʹE). The results showed that a hybrid system comprising 54.7 kW photovoltaic array, 7 kW fuel cell system, 14 kW power inverter and 3 kW electrolyzer with 8 kg hydrogen storage tank can sustainably augment the erratic grid with a very high renewable fraction of 96.7% at $0.0418/kWh. When compared with the conventional usage of grid/diesel generator system; energy cost saving of more than 88% and a return on investment of 41.3% with present worth of $308,965 can be derived in less than 3 years. The application of the optimally sized hybrid system would possibly help mitigate the rural-to-urban drift and resolve the electricity problems hindering the economic growth in Nigeria. Moreover, the hybrid system can alleviate CO2 emissions from other power generation sources to make the environment cleaner and more eco-friendly. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

However, the optimization and sizing for the capacity of such systems are challenging. In this regard, this study targets an improved optimization algorithm with high efficiency for optimization and long-term capacity planning of an off-grid hybrid renewable energy scheme composed of wind, fuel cell, and hydrogen storage schemes. The suggested methods are three improved versions of the global dynamic harmony search to do pitch adjustment mechanism. The objective function of this study is to reduce the total net annual cost of the system and the loss of power supply probability to a minimum. The performance of this hybrid system is examined via a simulation study, which had been performed on a remote area located in eastern Iran over a long period. The results of the three improved proposed algorithms are compared with the original global dynamic harmony search algorithm. Also, sensitivity analysis is proposed to showcase the influence of uncertainties on the system and input parameters on the algorithm. The simulation results indicate that three improved versions of the global dynamic harmony search algorithm ﬁnd more promising results than the original algorithm, and confirm the superior accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the global dynamic harmony search-II. Also, reliability level and iteration values have a considerable impact on the total net annual cost of the optimal hybrid energy system based on wind and hydrogen energy. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Practical classroom experiments are of great importance to students' learning and problems such as bureaucracy in the teaching department, high cost of equipment and lack of teacher time are some of the factors responsible for the delay in performing them in the classroom. Applying the Advanced Product Quality Planning methodology, Active Learning, thermodynamic and electrochemical modeling, it was possible to build an electrolyzer with about 150 US$. In the electrolyzer, the electrolytic solutions with 1 M concentration of NaOH and KOH were used, i.e., 39 g L−1 and 64 g L−1, respectively, to produce the gases hydrogen and oxygen. The flow of hydrogen and oxygen for the KOH electrolytic solution was 1.22 L min−1 and for the NaOH solution, 1.07 L min−1 was found using a 9–12 V and 8–15 A adjustable transformer. Among the undergraduate students who were interviewed, 54% did not know electrolysis and 46% knew just the basic concepts. After the practical experiment, it was observed that 94% of the students understood the concepts of the electrochemical reaction. Based on the averages of the two tests applied to students, before and after the practical experiment, an increase of 58% in the correctness of the questions was found for students who had not heard of electrolysis before and a 13% increase was observed for those who already knew the basic concepts. With this experiment, it was possible to observe how much practical activities in the classroom can positively influence the understanding of electrolysis and make students aware of this renewable energy production process. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The output power of a fuel cell is affected by operational parameters such as cell temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and hydrogen partial pressure. This paper deal with a two-stage grid-connected PEMFC system. In the first stage, a fuzzy logic controller is proposed to track the maximum power generated by PEMFC by using a boost converter. In the second stage, a multi-objective FSC-MPC two-step prediction to control of 3L-NPC is proposed. The use of Finite Control Set Model Predictive Control (FSC-MPC) can significantly improve the control performance of a three-level NPC (3L-NPC) inverter. Furthermore, this method uses the inverter's discrete behavior to find optimal switching states that minimize the cost function. The suggested model predictive control method for the 3L-NPC inverter is based on a multi-objective cost function that is meant to regulate inverter currents, dc-link voltage balance, and minimize the number of switch states. The performance of the proposed MO–FSC–MPCTS controlled 3L-NPC inverter is simulated with MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the suggested method ensures MPP tracking and injecting the current into the grid with a 2% THD. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Energy crisis has led the communities around the world to use energy hubs. These energy hubs usually consist of photovoltics, wind turbines and batteries. Diesel generators are usually used in these systems as backup system. In this research, for the first time, an attempt is made to replace the traditional diesel only backup system with hydrogen only system and combined hydrogen and diesel backup system in hybrid photovoltaic and wind turbine energy systems. After introducing the available energy modeling tools and methods, explaining over advantages and disadvantages of each one, HOMER software was selected for this research. The simulations of this research show that using the traditional diesel generator as the backup system of the energy hub, creates a low cost system with the net present cost (NPC) of 2.5 M$ but also produces the highest amount carbon emission which is equal to 686 tons/year. The results of this study also indicate the hybrid renewable energy system which is supported by the hydrogen only backup system has the highest net present cost (NPC) and initial capital cost but reduces the maximum amount of carbon. The calculated NPC and carbon production of the energy hub using hydrogen only backup system are equal to 4.39 M$ and 55,205, respectively. On the other hand, the combined hydrogen/diesel backup system has reduced NPC compared with the hydrogen only backup system. The CO2 production of this system is also lower than the diesel only backup system. The calculations indicate that the NPC and CO2 production of the combined backup system are 3.53 M$ and 511,695 kg/yr. By comparing advantages and disadvantages of all 3 scenarios, the micro grid which uses the combined diesel/hydrogen backup system is selected as the most optimal system. The sensitivity analysis of the selected system shows that fluctuations of inflation rate along with the fluctuations of both fuel cells and electrolyzers capital cost do not affect the net present cost (NPC) considerably. On the other hand, fluctuations of capital cost of the main components like wind turbines affect the NPC much more than the others. If the inflation rate drops from 15% to 14% and wind turbine capital cost multiplier reduces from 1 to 0.8, the NPC value will drop by the value of 300,000 $. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is regarded as a clean and highly efficient renewable energy. The platinum catalytic electrode is widely used in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but it has affected its commercial application because of its high cost. Therefore, the study on cost-effective and high-active catalysts toward HER is required to realise large-scale hydrogen production. In this work, we present a novel Pt/NPSSF catalyst prepared by a one-step in-situ deposition of Pt precursor on a nano-porous stainless-steel film (NPSSF) substrate. The prepared catalyst was evaluated in acidic and alkaline conditions for its HER activities. The preliminary results demonstrate that the Pt/NPSSF electrodes have superior catalytic activity for HER. The hydrogen overpotential of Pt/NPSSF is −70mV (RHE) in the alkaline solution, which is lower than the Pt electrode of −184mV. At the same time, we also obtained −71.2 mV of overpotential for the Pt/NPSSF electrode, which is similar to the −73mV of Pt electrode in the acid solution. The Tafel graphs plotted from the LSV curves indicate the different HER mechanism in the alkaline and acid solution. The HER kinetics of the Pt/NPSSF were studied using EIS. Comparing Pt/NPSSF to Pt electrode, the multi-pore structures of NPSSF and the Pt nanoparticles active sites decrease the charge transfer-resistance for the HER process. The facile preparation, high efficiency and low value of the Pt/NPSSF composite electrodes demonstrate the promising applications in HER. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen produced by the electrochemical water splitting is essential for expanding and utilizing renewable power sources and establishing a sustainable energy society. As renewable energy network widely established, the produced hydrogen can be utilized by connecting the energy demand and energy supply. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyser technology is one of the ideal candidates for direct coupling with renewable energy sources. In recent years, bench-scale experiments, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation-based approaches are used to accelerate the advances in performance and cost of the technology. We studied the influence of the key performance parameter of a PEM water electrolyser, and a single channel-based three-dimensional CFD model was developed. The PEM water electrolyser CFD model is validated against in-house experiments, where the developed model successfully predicts the current–voltage polarization curve. The developed CFD model is then used to analyze the influence of temperature, cathode pressure, membrane thickness, porous transport layer porosity and water feed rate. The main observation from the numerical study was discussed to provide insight into the factors affecting the PEM water electrolyser performance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The design of sustainable energy systems requires to enlarge the analysis beyond the traditional boundaries for including the economic, environmental, and societal needs and constraints in the decision-making process. In this regard, this work investigates the conceptual design of distributed energy systems by means of a multi-objective optimization strategy to simultaneously address the economic, environmental, and social aspects in the energy system design. Initially, the water consumption and the inherent safety indicators were introduced and evaluated through two single-objective optimization problems to enhance the analysis of the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. Then, a framework including the total annualized cost, CO2 emissions, water consumption, grid dependence, and inherent safety index was used to perform the multi-objective analysis. To carry out a thorough and comprehensive analysis, four optimization problems including different combinations of the sustainability indicators were proposed and solved. The compromise among the objective functions was identified, and the obtained Pareto sets were explored for elucidating the changes in the design and operating conditions across the non-dominated solutions. According to results, the cost of energy can range between 0.37 and 0.63 €/kWh, the CO2 emissions can vary between 10.6 and 68.5 kgCO2/MWh, and the water consumption can be between 27.8 and 70.2 m3H2O/GWh depending on the evaluated objective. Moreover, it was determined that the safety of the energy system can be improved by increasing the use of the water electrolysis pathway to produce hydrogen and by reducing the capacity of the hydrogen storage unit. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The model includes hydrogen grades and separation/purification technologies, offering the possibility to assess the effects that hydrogen grades play in the development of cost-effective hydrogen supply chains, including the decisions to repurpose gas distribution networks or blending hydrogen into them. The model is implemented in a case study of Great Britain, for a set of decarbonisation and learning rate scenarios. A base case with a medium carbon price scenario shows that the total discounted cost of the hydrogen supply chain is significantly higher than shown in previous studies, largely due to the additional costs from purification/separation needed to meet hydrogen purity standards for transport applications. Furthermore, it was shown that producing hydrogen from steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage; installing new transmission pipelines; repurposing the gas distribution network to supply 100% hydrogen; and purifying hydrogen with a pressure swing adsorption system locally at the refuelling station; is a cost optimal configuration for the given technoeconomic assumptions, providing hydrogen at £6.18 per kg at the pump. Purification technologies were found to contribute to 14% and 30% of total discounted investment and operation costs respectively, highlighting the importance of explicitly including them into hydrogen supply chain models for the transport sector. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The coupling of a photovoltaic system with PEMFC was preferred to supply continuous production of electric energy throughout the year. Additionally, produced heat from PEMFC was used to heating of the greenhouse by micro cogeneration application. The MATLAB/Simulink was applied to the design and optimization of the proposed hybrid system. In the designed system, solar energy was selected to produce the Hydrogen (H2) required to run the electrolyzer. In cases where the solar energy is not sufficient and cannot meet the electricity requirement for the electrolyzer; the H2 requirement for the operation of the PEMFC was met from the H2 storage tanks and energy continuity was ensured. The electrolyzer was designed for H2 demand of the 3 kW PEMFC which were met the greenhouse energy requirement. PEMFC based hybrid system has 48% electrical and 45% thermal efficiencies. According to optimization results obtained for the proposed hybrid system, the levelized cost of energy was found 0.117 $/kWh.

	abstract = {The flexible operation of alkaline water electrolyzers enables power-to-x plants to react efficiently to different energy scenarios. In this work, a novel scheduling model for alkaline water electrolysis is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. The model is constructed by implementing operational states (production, standby, idle) and transitions (cold/full startup, shutdown) as integer variables, while the power loading and hydrogen flowrate are set as continuous variables. The operational characteristics (load range, startup time, ramp rates) are included as model constraints. The proposed model allows finding optimal number of electrolyzers and production schedules when dealing with large data sets of intermittent energy and electricity price. The optimal solution of the case study shows a balance between hydrogen production, energy absorption, and operation and investment costs. The optimal number of electrolyzers to be installed corresponds to 54% of the ones required to absorb the highest energy peak, being capable of loading 89.7% of the available energy during the year of operation, with an overall plant utilization of 93.7% and 764 startup/shutdown cycles evenly distributed among the units. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Following the European Union's emission reduction goals, the expansion of intermittent renewable energy sources is being pursued by numerous member states. This poses challenges especially to low-voltage electricity grids that are not designed for the volatile and unpredictable feed-in from renewable generation capacity. In addition to the expansion of renewable capacity, further measures, including the decarbonization of the transport, heating and industrial sectors are needed to achieve the environmental targets. Sector coupling refers to the electrification of end-user energy demand as well as the coupling of different energy infrastructures such as the electricity and gas networks through Power-to-Gas technology. In this paper, we address these issues by developing a methodology that enables distribution system operators to identify future grid constraints in advance and to address them using Power-to-Gas technology using geographical information systems. In further detail, we present a novel approach to identify sections of the distribution network that are likely to be congested in the future in order to locate congestion-induced potential sites for Power-to-Gas plants. We show the applicability of our approach in a case study for a municipality in the German state of Baden-Wurttemberg. We show the economic feasibility of a medium-sized Power-to-Gas plant that couples the gas and electricity distribution networks. Our findings offer insights into the possibility to use the existing gas infrastructure in order to integrate surplus electricity generation, avoid electricity grid congestion and to further decarbonize energy demand. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Mountain huts, as special, stand-alone, micro-grid systems, are not connected to a power grid and represent a burden on the environment. The micro-grid has to be flexible to cover daily and seasonal fluctuations. Heat and electricity are usually generated with fossil fuels due to the simple on-off operation. By introducing renewable energy sources (RESs), the generation of energy could be more sustainable, but the generation and consumption must be balanced. The paper describes the integration of a hydrogen-storage system (HSS) and a battery-storage system (BattS) in a mountain hut. The HSS involves a proton-exchange-membrane water electrolyser (PEMWE), a hydrogen storage tank (H2 tank), a PEM fuel cell (PEMFC) and a BattS consisting of lead-acid batteries. Eight micro-grid configurations were modelled using HOMER and evaluated from the technical, environmental and economic points of view. A life-cycle assessment analysis was made from the cradle to the gate. The micro-grid configurations with the HSS achieve, on average, a more than 70% decrease in the environmental impacts in comparison to the state of play at the beginning, but require a larger investment. Comparing the HSS with the BattS as a seasonal energy storage, the hydrogen-based technology had advantages for all of the assessed criteria. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {The transport sector is considered as one of the sectors producing high carbon emissions worldwide due to the use of fossil fuels. Hydrogen is a non-toxic energy carrier that could serve as a good alternative to fossil fuels. The use of hydrogen vehicles could help reduce carbon emissions thereby cutting down on greenhouse gases and environmental pollution. This could largely be achieved when hydrogen is produced from renewable energy sources and is easily accessible through a widespread network of hydrogen refuelling stations. In this study, the techno-economic assessment was performed for a wind-powered hydrogen refuelling station in seven cities of South Africa. The aim is to determine the optimum configuration of a hydrogen refuelling station powered by wind energy resources for each of the cities as well as to determine their economic viability and carbon emission reduction capability. The stations were designed to cater for 25 hydrogen vehicles every day, each with a 5 kg tank capacity. The results show that a wind-powered hydrogen refuelling station is viable in South Africa with the cost of hydrogen production ranging from 6.34 $/kg to 8.97 $/kg. These costs are competitive when compared to other costs of hydrogen production around the world. The cities located in the coastal region of South Africa are more promising for siting wind powered-hydrogen refuelling station compared to the cities located on the mainland. The hydrogen refuelling stations could reduce the CO2 and CO emissions by 73.95 tons and 0.133 tons per annum, respectively. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Although polymer electrolyte membrane water-electrolyzers can produce green hydrogen by means of excess electricity generated from renewable energy sources, their operation is still not economical. According to industry experts, the necessary cost reductions can be achieved by 2030 if system efficiency can be improved. The commonly stated idea is to improve efficiency by increasing the stack temperature, which requires the development of more resistant materials. This study investigates not only the efficiency of an electrolysis cell, but of the entire electrolysis process, including gas compression of hydrogen. The results indicate that an optimal stack temperature exists for every operating point. It is shown that the optimal temperature depends solely on the electrode pressure and cell voltage and can be analytically calculated. In addition, the temperature optimization leads to significantly reduced hydrogen permeation at low current densities. In combination with the pressure optimization, the challenging safety issues of pressurized electrolysis can be eliminated for the entire load range and, at the same time, the efficiency of the overall system be maximized. © 2020},

	abstract = {Can aviation really become less polluting? The electrification of airport energy system as a micro-grid is a promising solution to achieve zero emission airport operation, however such electrification approach presents the engineering challenge of integrating new energy resources, such as hydrogen supply and solar energy as attractive options to decarbonize the present system. This paper explores the techno-economic benefits of integrating hydrogen supply, electric auxiliary power unit (APU) of aircraft, electric vehicles, photovoltaic energy (PV), and battery storage system into electrified airport energy system. The hydrogen fuel cell generation provides great flexibility to supply aircraft at remote stands, and reduces the carbon emissions caused by traditional fuel-powered APU. A mixed integer linear programming optimization method based on life cycle theory is developed for capacity sizing of hydrogen energy system, PV and battery storage, with optimization objective of minimizing the total economic costs as well as considering environmental benefits of the proposed airport microgrid system. Case studies are conducted by five different energy integration scenarios with techno-economic and environmental assessments to quantify the benefits of integrating hydrogen and renewable energy into airport. Compared with the benchmark scenarios, the integration of hydrogen energy system reduced the total annual costs and carbon emissions of airport energy system by 41.6% and 67.29%, respectively. Finally, sensitivity analysis of key system parameters such as solar irradiance, grid emission factor, elctricity price, carbon tax, unit investment cost of hydrogen energy system have been investigated to inform the design of hydrogen-solar-storage integrated energy system for future airport electrification. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The urge to increase renewable energy penetration into the power supply mix has been frequently highlighted in response to climate change. South Korea was analyzed as a case study for which the government has shown motivation to increase renewable energy penetration. Herein, a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) including solar and wind energies were selected due to their relatively stable and mature technology. In addition, Power-to-X has been incorporated to cover other renewable energy options such as hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG). Therefore, an approach of forecasting the weather characteristics and demand loading over a relatively long timeframe was implemented via deep learning techniques (LSTM and GRU) and statistical approaches (Fbprophet and SARIMA), respectively. A deployment strategy incorporating HRES and Power-to-X is then proposed in correspondence to the forecasted results of the 15 regions considered in this study. An extension of this, the reliability of the designed system is further assessed based on the probability of the demand losses with the aid of Monte-Carlo simulation. With the proposed deployment strategy, a total annual cost of 9.88 × 1011 $/year and a greenhouse gas reduction of 1.24 × 106 tons/year are expected for a 35% renewable energy penetration. However, only SNG shows relatively competitive cost (at 23.20 $/m3 SNG), whereas the average costs of electricity (0.133 $/kWh) and hydrogen (7.784 $/kg H2) across the regions are yet to be competitive compared to the current market prices. Nonetheless, the priority of deployment across regions has been identified via TOPSIS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Long term and stable operation of these systems require an in-depth understanding of materials stability under anodic and cathodic exposure conditions of the cell and cell stacks. In the present study, we report our findings on the corrosion of Ni in the presence and absence of (Li–Na) hydroxide melt at 600 °C under oxidizing and reducing conditions representative of HTWE. While the Ni electrode was found to remain thermodynamically stable in metallic form under cathodic (reducing) exposure conditions, the corrosion rate in molten hydroxide under oxidizing conditions was found to be non-parabolic in nature. A cyclic voltammetry study provides the breakdown of the passive metal-oxide surface layer at the anodic overpotential region between 0.45 V and 2 V in molten hydroxide under oxidizing conditions. A thermochemical process for accelerated corrosion based on the oxide scale fluxing in hydroxide melt has been developed. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) can be a critical factor in achieving a more sustainable society reducing carbon emissions worldwide in the long run. However, there are some challenges to be solved yet. One of these challenges is that, right now, the economical competitiveness of electrolysis production strongly depends on the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) availability. This paper analyzes the economic and environmental implications of complementing the power supply of a H2 production plant that usually operates using only RES with grid electricity during the time RES are not available. For performing this analysis, we proposed an assessment model that incorporates Alkaline (ALK) and PEM electrolyzer technology features (such as the low dynamic load range of ALK electrolyzers, which is usually ignored when modeling H2 production). Moreover, we introduce a new metric, named the LCOH&E, which captures the existing trade-off between reducing the Levelized Cost Of Hydrogen (LCOH) with more H2 production using grid electricity and increasing CO2 emissions by producing more H2 with grid electricity. We illustrate the proposed assessment model with a case study based on real data from Chile. Our results show that the optimal fraction of grid electricity to be used in producing H2 may be different when minimizing the LCOH and when minimizing the LCOH&E because of the LCOH-CO2 emissions’ trade off. Moreover, it is remarkable that using only 10% of grid electricity in an ALK electrolyzer, it is possible to increase the H2 production in 25.7%, without significantly increasing the CO2 emission level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Increased electricity production from renewable energy resources, coupled with low natural gas (NG) prices, has caused existing light-water reactors (LWRs) to experience diminishing returns from the electricity market. This reduction in revenue is forcing LWRs to consider alternative revenue streams, such as introduction hydrogen production or desalination, to remain profitable. This paper performs a technoeconomic assessment (TEA) regarding the viability of retrofitting existing pressurized-water reactors (PWRs) to produce green hydrogen (H2) via high-temperature steam electrolysis (HTSE). Such an integration would allow nuclear facilities to expand into additional markets that may be more profitable in the long term and eliminate CO2 emissions from the hydrogen production process. To accommodate such an integration, a detailed single market levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) and multimarket analyses were conducted of HTSE process operation, requirements, costing, and flexibility. Alongside this costing analysis, market analyses were conducted on the electric and hydrogen markets in the PJM interconnect. Utilizing a novel stochastic, dispatch optimization approach results suggest that a positive gain is achievable, and by operating in multiple markets, the nuclear facility can avoid the sale of electricity during times of low electricity market pricing, while maintaining the ability to capitalize on the high electricity market pricing. It should be noted that the analysis conducted is a differential cash flow analysis and, as such, does not present profit levels. LCOH analysis results demonstrate the potential exists to produce hydrogen at a cost as low as $1.20/kg. This price is lower than traditional steam methane reforming (SMR) allowing nuclear based hydrogen production to disrupt the existing hydrogen production market. © 2021},

	abstract = {The paper proposes a hybrid microgrid (HMG) system with solar modules and wind turbines as primary energy sources and a diesel engine as backup. Meanwhile, the hydrogen energy storage system (HySS) is utilized as energy storage. Firstly, by reducing the levelized cost of energy (COE), this study presents the optimal size and configuration of various renewable and distributed energy resources in HMG systems. Secondly, two novel modified hybridized particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO) are developed, namely, ACO initialized PSO and ACO updated PSO. The optimal simulation results using PSO and ACO metaheuristic technique either individually or hybridized are compared in terms of primarily minimizing the levelized COE and achieving short execution time. Thirdly, to verify the geographical-independency of the integration of HySS for producing onsite green hydrogen locally, the estimation performance is examined for three different locations in Egypt, Mozambique and Denmark respectively using hourly meteorological and load data in 2019. Sensitivity and effectiveness analysis are carried out to highlight the major parameters that impact HySS incorporation. Finally, the system readiness level together with the different hydrogen, economy barriers constraints, limitations and risks are investigated based on the technology readiness level and the integration readiness level indices. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the ACO updated PSO optimization algorithm towards minimizing the levelized COE in the different regions. In the developing countries, the salvage market supports HySS integration. At system readiness levels range between 0.65 and 0.94, versatile HySS integration is verified. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive approach for estimating the development of global production and supply costs of low-carbon hydrogen from renewable energy sources (onshore wind, offshore wind and solar photovoltaics) and natural gas (natural gas reforming with carbon capture and storage and natural gas pyrolysis) until 2050. The analysis also assesses the costs associated with the transportation of hydrogen by ship or pipeline. The combination of production and transportation costs yields a ranking of cost-optimal supply sources for individual countries. Estimation results suggest that natural gas reforming with carbon capture and storage will be the most cost-efficient low-carbon hydrogen production pathway in the medium term (2020–2030). Production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources could become competitive in the long run (2030–2050) if capital costs decrease significantly. Until 2050, minimum production costs for hydrogen from renewable energy sources could fall to $1.5/kg under central assumptions and to below $1/kg under optimistic assumptions in some regions. The cost-optimal long-term hydrogen supply depends on regional characteristics, such as renewable energy potentials and gas prices. Imports of hydrogen from renewable energy sources are cost-effective where domestic production potential is small and/or cost-intensive. Additionally, good import conditions exist for countries which are connected to prospective low-cost exporters via existing natural gas pipelines that can be retrofitted to transport hydrogen. Due to the high cost of seaborne transport, hydrogen trade will most likely develop regionally along pipeline networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This was done by proposing connecting the utility to a hybrid system constituting from photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), and fuel cell (FC) systems where this hybrid system is considered as a backup system that works when the grid is unavailable. This hybrid system proposed is used for feeding the load to a tourist resort in Hurghada, Egypt. The design of the introduced system has taken into consideration the cost of purchasing electric energy and the profit from selling it to the utility network. Component scaling was implemented to improve the net present cost of the proposed system using two grouped meta-heuristic techniques, which are the Hybrid Firefly and Harmony Search optimization technique (HFA/HS) and compared to the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. Simulation results have shown that the optimal system for solving the grid unavailability consists of eighty PVs, two WTs, twenty FCs, forty-one electrolyzers, and one hundred eighteen hydrogen tanks. The results also showed that the volume of exchange with the grid has reached 4 GW of purchase and 3 GW of sale. It is manifest from the results that the suggested system is economically viable with an LCOE of 0.0628 $/kWh, which is less than the purchase of electricity from the grid for commercial users in Egypt, which is 0.1 $/kWh. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This study develops peer-to-peer energy trading management and optimization approaches of renewable energy systems integrated with energy storage of hydrogen and battery vehicles for power supply to a diversified net-zero energy community. Typical net-zero energy community models are developed and compared with different storage vehicle types (hydrogen vehicle/battery vehicle) and energy trading modes (peer-to-grid/peer-to-peer). Multi-objective peer-to-peer trading optimizations of the net-zero energy community with both hydrogen and battery vehicles are developed to explore the optimal interactive impact of vehicle numbers and management strategies. An improved peer-to-peer trading management strategy is further proposed considering the peer trading priority and complementary operations of hybrid vehicle storage. The study results indicate that the hydrogen vehicle-integrated system achieves superior supply performances, while the battery vehicle-integrated system performs better on the grid integration, economic and environmental aspects. The time-of-use peer trading strategy should be adopted when the battery vehicle number in office buildings is relatively small, and the strategy without time-of-use management is preferred when the vehicle numbers in diversified building groups are relatively large for a techno-economic-environmental optimization. Obvious improvements can be achieved by the improved peer trading strategy, with reductions on the net grid import by 18.54%, carbon emissions by 1594.13 tons, net electricity bill by 8.31% and lifetime net present value by US$ 458.69 k.

Apparent activation energies (Ea) were estimated to be ca. 10.5 kJ mol−1 for the HER on Nb. Thus, Nb is a good electrocatalyst for the cathodic H2 manufacturing. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Intermittency is one of the main obstacles that inhibit the wide adoption of the renewable energy in the power sector. Small-scale fluctuations can be tackled by short-term energy storage system, whereas long-term or seasonal intermittencies rely on large-scale energy management solutions. Besides the supply and demand mismatch in temporal domain, renewable energy sources are usually far away from consumption points. To connect the energy sources to the demand cost-effectively, cable transmission is usually the default option, and considering the long distance, other emerging energy carriers such as hydrogen could be a feasible option. However, there is handful studies on the quantitative evaluation of the long-distance energy transmission cost. This paper investigated the economic feasibility of renewable energy transmission via routes of power cable and gas pipeline. In the direct power transmission case, renewable energy is transmitted via HVDC cable and then converted to hydrogen for convenient storage. The alternative case converts renewable energy into hydrogen at the source and transports the hydrogen in the gas pipeline to consumers. Existing data available from public domain are used for cost estimation. Results show that the improvements of capacity factor and transmission scale are the most cost-effective approach to make the renewable hydrogen economically viable. At 4000 km of transmission distance, renewable hydrogen LCOE of 7 US$/kg and 9 US$/kg are achievable for the corresponding optimum cases, respectively. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {While a lot of countries put renewable energy sources at the heart of their decarbonization strategies with directed incentive mechanisms, the variability of the renewable energy sources, remains a major challenge for electricity system operators in ensuring the security of supply. This challenge is particularly onerous when there is a coincidence between this variability and congestion of the tie-lines. Renewable generation spillage often leads to constraints being placed on the output of renewable energy sources. This situation causes a significant cost for electricity system operators due to the need for constraint payments to be made to renewable generations. These increased costs will ultimately be recovered from energy customers. Maintaining the balance in the aforementioned decarbonization, security of supply and affordability is a challenge that constitutes the energy trilemma. The integration of electric power systems with other energy infrastructures, e.g., natural gas, could be a promising solution for achieving a balanced performance in the energy trilemma, controlling the fluctuation of renewable energy sources, and increasing the flexibility of the integrated systems. Considering this, a hybrid bridging-operational framework based on the vector-bridging system concept is proposed. Also, a day-ahead integrated scheduling model is proposed that optimizes the integrated operation by considering the constraint payment costs in a linear optimization model. Simulation results on a large test system indicated that the hybrid bridging-operational framework could reduce the total cost of the congested system by 65% and release up to 10% of the pipeline capacities while harvesting the wind generation and removing constraint payments to wind generators. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Hydrogen will become a dominant energy carrier in the future and the efficiency and lifetime cost of its production through water electrolysis is a major research focus. Alongside efforts to offer optimum solutions through plant design and sizing, it is also necessary to develop a flexible virtualised replica of renewable hydrogen plants, that not only models compatibility with the “plug-and-play” nature of many facilities, but that also identifies key elements for optimisation of system operation. This study presents a model for a renewable hydrogen production plant based on real-time historical and present-day datasets of PV connected to a virtualised grid-connected AC microgrid comprising different technologies of batteries, electrolysers, and fuel cells. Mathematical models for each technology were developed from chemical and physical metrics of the plant. The virtualised replica is the first step toward the implementation of a digital twin of the system, and accurate validation of the system behaviour when updated with real-time data. As a case study, a solar hydrogen pilot plant consisting of a 60 kW Solar PV, a 40 kW PEM electrolyser, a 15 kW LIB battery and a 5 kW PEM fuel cell were simulated and analysed. Two effective operational factors on the plant's performance are defined: (i) electrolyser power settings to determine appropriate hydrogen production over twilight periods and/or overnight and (ii) a user-defined minimum threshold for battery state of charge to prevent charge depletion overnight if the electrolyser load is higher than its capacity. The objective of this modelling is to maximise hydrogen yield while both loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and microgrid excess power are minimised. This analysis determined: (i) a hydrogen yield of 38–39% from solar DC energy to hydrogen energy produced, (ii) an LPSP <2.6 × 10−4 and (iii) < 2% renewable energy lost to the grid as excess electricity for the case study. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The volatility of fossil fuel and their increased consumption have exacerbated the socio-economic dilemma along with electricity expenses in third world countries around the world, Pakistan in particular. In this research, we study the output of renewable hydrogen from natural sources like wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal power. It also provides rules and procedures in an attempt to determine the current situation of Pakistan regarding the workability of upcoming renewable energy plans. To achieve this, four main criteria were assessed and they are economic, commercial, environmental, and social adoption. The method used in this research is the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP), where we used first-order engineering equations, and Levelized cost electricity to produce renewable hydrogen. The value of renewable hydrogen is also evaluated. The results of the study indicate that wind is the best option in Pakistan for manufacturing renewable based on four criteria. Biomass is found to be the most viable raw material for the establishment of the hydrogen supply network in Pakistan, which can generate 6.6 million tons of hydrogen per year, next is photovoltaic solar energy, which has the capability of generating 2.8 million tons. Another significant finding is that solar energy is the second-best candidate for hydrogen production taking into consideration its low-cost installation and production. The study shows that the cost of using hydrogen in Pakistan ranges from $5.30/kg to $5.80/kg, making it a competitive fuel for electric machines. Such projects for producing renewable power must be highlighted and carried out in Pakistan and this will lead to more energy security for Pakistan, less use of fossil fuels, and effective reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This study discusses the injection, storage and production of hydrogen in an open saline aquifer anticline using industry standard reservoir engineering software, and investigates the role of cushion gas, one of the main cost uncertainties of hydrogen storage in porous media. The results show that one well can inject and reproduce enough hydrogen in a saline aquifer anticline to cover 25% of the annual hydrogen energy required to decarbonise the domestic heating of East Anglia (UK). Cushion gas plays an important role and its injection in saline aquifers is dominated by brine displacement and accompanied by high pressures. The required ratio of cushion gas to working gas depends strongly on geological parameters including reservoir depth, the shape of the trap, and reservoir permeability, which are investigated in this study. Generally, deeper reservoirs with high permeability are favoured. The study shows that the volume of cushion gas directly determines the working gas injection and production performance. It is concluded that a thorough investigation into the cushion gas requirement, taking into account cushion gas costs as well as the cost-benefit of cushion gas in place, should be an integral part of a hydrogen storage development plan in saline aquifers. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Integrated energy system modeling tools predominantly focus on the (inter)national or local scales. The intermediate level is important from the perspective of regional policy making, particularly for identifying the potentials and constraints of various renewable resources. Additionally, distribution variations of economic and social sectors, such as housing, agriculture, industries, and energy infrastructure, foster regional energy demand differences. We used an existing optimization-based national integrated energy system model, Options Portfolio for Emission Reduction Assessment or OPERA, for our analysis. The modeling framework was subdivided into four major blocks: the economic structure, the built environment and industries, renewable energy potentials, and energy infrastructure, including district heating. Our scenario emphasized extensive use of intermittent renewables to achieve low greenhouse gas emissions. Our multi-node, regionalized model revealed the significant impacts of spatial parameters on the outputs of different technology options. Our case study was the northern region of the Netherlands. The region generated a significant amount of hydrogen (H2) from offshore wind, i.e. 620 Peta Joule (PJ), and transmitted a substantial volume of H2 (390 PJ) to the rest of the Netherlands. Additionally, the total renewable share in the primary energy mix of almost every northern region is ∼90% or more compared to ∼70% for the rest of the Netherlands. The results confirm the added value of regionalized modeling from the perspective of regional policy making as opposed to relying solely on national energy system models. Furthermore, we suggest that the regionalization of national models is an appropriate method to analyze regional energy systems. © 2021 The Authors},

The industrial energy park is a separate area consisting of multiple distributed generations, energy storage systems, etc., which supply local gas, heating, and electrical consumers. Meanwhile, the integration of power-to-X technologies such as power-to-gas and power-to-heat, which convert the electricity into other forms of energies while facilitating the integration of renewable energy in the industrial park, can enhance the flexibility and efficiency of energy supply. Therefore, this paper proposes novel robust energy management of multi-energy industrial parks integrated with wind power resources, cogeneration units, power-to-X technologies, and demand response programs to total operation cost minimization. The industrial park can simultaneously participate in a multi-energy market, including power, thermal, and gas markets, to meet local heating, gas, and electrical load. The robust optimization framework is extended to address the power price uncertainty and manage the conservatism level of the operator against price variability. The proposed model is examined on the industrial park test system, and numerical results will be presented for the different cases. Under the robust energy management, the total operation cost of the multi-energy industrial park reduces up to 53 %. © 2021},

	abstract = {The growing interest in integrating variable renewable energy resources (RES), besides global concerns about greenhouse pollution, brings multiple challenges for eco and environmentally-friendly operation of systems. Meanwhile, the simultaneous energy supply can improve energy efficiency and mitigate the fluctuation of RES compared with a single-energy system. Therefore, this paper seeks to investigate the optimal scheduling of heating, power, and hydrogen-based microgrid incorporated with RES and plug-in electric vehicles (PEV). The fuel-cell-based hydrogen and electrolyzer facilities are integrated into the multi-energy system to investigate the power-to-hydrogen and hydrogen-to-power technologies in the model. Besides typical electric and thermal loads, the proposed system can directly sell hydrogen to hydrogen-based industrial applications. The PEV as a flexible resource is employed to facilitate the integration of solar energy. Due to the substantial uncertainty from solar energy, price, load, and EVs' arriving and departing times, the risk management of the model based on the conditional value-at-risk is developed to show the operator's behavior against the random inputs and their risk. Results show that integrating the hydrogen storage and plug-in electric vehicle in the model results in a daily cost reduction of up to 9.28%. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This paper details a methodology to estimate the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of meeting this seasonal imbalance with either a hydrogen-fired gas turbine (HFGT) or lithium-ion battery system (LI) as a measure of economic efficiency of the technologies. Applying our model, we find the average LCOE associated with meeting this seasonal imbalance is $2400/MWh using a HFGT fueled with green hydrogen and $3000/MWh using a LI. If we allow the model to operate the HFGT with blue hydrogen the average LCOE decreases to $1560/MWh. However, we find the power prices required to justify investment in an HFGT to replace a natural gas-fired gas turbine are considerably higher than those seen in the market today. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Here, we simulate high renewable zero-emission energy system architectures with heat supply based on the major options of district heating, heat pumps, and electrolytic hydrogen boilers. We adopt a novel whole system modelling approach that combines meteorology-driven hourly simulations of demand and supply with storage, flexible technologies, and interconnections on the European scale. Our results show that systems with heat supply based on consumer or district heat pumps require about four times less electricity per unit of heat, with a heat cost about half of that from electrolytic hydrogen boilers. Furthermore, we compare trade-offs between investment in different infrastructure components.

	abstract = {While industrial demand response programmes have long been valued to support the power grid, recent advances in information and communications technology have enabled new opportunities to leverage the potential of responsive loads in less energy-dense end-use sectors. This brings to light the importance of accurately projecting flexible demand-side resources in the long-term investment planning process of micro-grids. This paper introduces a customer comfort-aware, demand response-integrated long-term micro-grid planning optimisation model. The model (1) draws on non-cooperative game theory and the Stackelberg leadership principles to understand and reflect the strategic behaviour of energy utilities, demand response aggregators, and end-consumers, (2) produces optimal trade-offs between power imported from the main grid and available demand response resources, (3) determines the cost-optimal resource allocation for energy infrastructure, including multiple energy storage systems, and (4) provides a level playing field for emerging technologies, such as power-to-gas and vehicle-to-grid interventions. The multi-energy-storage-technology test-case was effectively applied to achieve 100%-renewable energy generation for the town of Ohakune, New Zealand. Numerical simulation results suggest that the proposed incentive-compatible demand-side management market-clearing mechanism is able to estimate the cost-optimal solution for the provision of renewable energy during the planning phase. The cost-optimal system saves ~21% (equating to around US$5.5 m) compared to a business-as-usual approach, where the participation of end-users in demand response programmes is projected by running uniform price demand response auctions. The most salient distinction of the proposed two-stage (wholesale and retail) demand-side management market model is the continual process of trading, with incentive prices unique to each transaction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, renewable energy sources (RESs) have attracted substantial attention due to carbon-free and cost-effective advantages that have made them one of the main sources of energy generation in the modern structure of the power grid. This paper proposes the stochastic day-ahead scheduling model for optimal energy management of renewable-based microgrids. In this paper, each microgrid is equipped with 100% RESs including the PV system and wind turbine for full pollutant-free energy generation while the hydrogen energy storage (HES) system is used for alleviating the intermittences of the RESs aiming to dynamically balance the energy during a day. To model the fluctuations such as day-ahead market price in the microgrids, the autoregressive integrated moving average and fast forward selection methods are exerted for scenario production and reduction, respectively. Transactive energy as a sustainable and reliable technique is considered for controlling and coordinating energy sharing among the microgrids and the energy network for dynamic energy balancing in the deregulated environment. For energy management in the demand-side, the price and load response schemes are presented, aiming to revise the consumers' patterns in energy consumption in line with balancing energy and minimizing the microgrids’ energy cost. The effectiveness of the suggested model is validated using the modified IEEE 24-bus case study. The realistic modeling of the system based on the proposed model has led to an 8.51% increment in energy cost. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In the current system, hydrogen generated by an alkaline water electrolyzer was directly supplied to hydrogenation reactors, where hydrogen purification equipment such as PSA and TSA is not installed to decrease costs. Hydrogen buffer tanks and compressors are not equipped. In order to enable MCH production using fluctuating electricity, a feed-forward toluene supply control method was developed and introduced to the system. The electrolyzer was operated under triangular waves and power generation patterns of photovoltaic cells and produced hydrogen with fluctuating flow rates up to 7.5 Nm3/h. Consequently, relatively high purity of MCH (more than 90% of MCH mole fraction) was successfully produced. Therefore, the simplified system has enough potential to produce MCH using fluctuating renewable electricity. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The use of hydrogen as a clean and renewable energy source is increasing rapidly for both vehicle and stationary applications. There are safety concerns for the locations in which hydrogen is made, used, and transported (i.e., pipelines and tanker trucks). Sensors are needed to comply with safety regulations and to enable a smooth and safe rollout of hydrogen as an alternative energy. However, hydrogen sensors do not yet exist that have the combined features of small size and low power for easy deployment coupled with high-volume manufacturability and low cost. This is necessary to accommodate the emerging fixed and mobile markets while retaining critical metrological metrics, including measurement range, detection limits, selectivity, fast response, stability, and long lifetime. An amperometric gas sensor for hydrogen (AGS) has been developed using an innovative manufacturing method. The sensor was designed using scalable fabrication strategies based on “Printed Electronics” (PE) methodology which are compatible with large-scale production. Prototype sensors were batch fabricated with multiple individual elements on a substrate compatible in size with a standard 8-inch wafer to enable high-volume, low-cost manufacturing, thereby leveraging PE and semiconductor fabrication infrastructure. This novel AGS was instrumented with control circuitry and evaluated for hydrogen detection in the range of 0–5000 ppmv H2 in air. Specific performance evaluations included assessment of the sensor measurement range, repeatability, and selectivity. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is considered a promising green energy carrier due to its long storage period and zero harmful emissions. The green hydrogen produced by water electrolysis using renewable energy is indispensable for expanding the renewable energy grid and establishing a clean energy society. As renewable power sources are widely deployed, hydrogen can be utilized to connect the energy demand section with the energy supply section. To transport hydrogen to demand sites, one of the most common commercial methods is hydrogen compression. Notably, high-pressure water electrolysis does not need to additionally compress hydrogen, which can significantly diminish the cost of hydrogen production. In this study, to evaluate the effect of the operating pressure on the performance of an alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) system, a numerical model of the AWE system was developed using Aspen Plus®. The AWE system is comprised of the AWE stack, water pumps, heat exchangers, separator, condenser, and electric heat pump (EHP) system. The AWE stack model is validated by comparing the current–voltage polarization curve with experimental data. Simulation results show that an appropriate pressure makes the system more efficient due to decreasing the power consumption of the balance of plant (BOP). Furthermore, high-pressure water electrolysis has a large advantage for obtaining high-purity hydrogen (over 99.9%) without using a water adsorption device. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

By contrast, hydrogen produced using electrolysis and zero-emissions electricity does not create GHG emissions. Several countries advocating the use of ‘clean’ hydrogen put both technologies in the same category. Recent studies and strategies have compared these technologies, typically assuming high carbon capture rates, but have not assessed the impact of fugitive emissions and lower capture rates on total emissions and costs. We find that emissions from gas or coal based hydrogen production systems could be substantial even with CCS, and the cost of CCS is higher than often assumed. Carbon avoidance costs for high capture rates are notable. Carbon prices of $22–46/tCO2e would be required to make hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCS competitive with hydrogen produced from fossil fuels without CCS. At the same time there are indications that electrolysis with renewable energy could become cheaper than fossil fuel with CCS options, possibly in the near-term future. Establishing hydrogen supply chains on the basis of fossil fuels, as many national strategies foresee, may be incompatible with decarbonisation objectives and raise the risk of stranded assets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is no doubt that energy will have one of highest priorities in agendas of strategic plans of countries. Since fossil fuels are running out and carbon emissions are more important than ever, researchers seek alternative clean and efficient energy sources. One of the best alternatives is hydrogen. The systems in which hydrogen flows from its production to end users are called hydrogen supply chains (HSC). Since hydrogen is not in active use, its HSC infrastructure is not complete and should be planned very carefully. We study the design of HSC of Turkey to meet the hydrogen demand of the period between 2021 and 2050. Our aim is to minimize total cost of the HSC while meeting the demand of the transportation sector. We address the problem by using a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and derive several insights for the future HSC. The results show that while decentralization (being able to fulfill the demand from local production facilities) is 12% in the first period, this rate raises up to 48% by the end of the planning horizon. Analysis also reveal that almost all grids do not produce and import hydrogen simultaneously, i.e., they either produce or import hydrogen. The results are robust in the sense that solutions of different optimality gaps have minor differences in terms of established facilities. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hybrid energy storage systems have been increasingly envisaged for building microgrids to soften the drawbacks arising from the unpredictability of renewable energy resources and dwelling occupancy. The combination of long- and short-term energy storage systems can enhance the building microgrid capacity of shifting the demand peak toward periods of power generation, increasing the marks of self-consumption rate. However, the design of energy management systems for hybrid energy storage microgrids is more complex than single ones due to a greater number possible solutions. Faced with this issue, this paper proposes a two-level Hierarchical Model Predictive Controller (HMPC) enhanced by two data-driven modules to improve the performance of building microgrids equipped with hybrid energy storage continuously and automatically. With minimum pre-design steps, the two data-driven algorithms improve the accuracy of Li-ion batteries and hydrogen storage models and determine adequate parameters for the HMPC cost function. Relying predominantly on data measurements, the proposed hierarchical controller determines which energy storage device must be run on a daily basis based on the estimation of the annual self-consumption rate and the annual microgrid operation costs. This real-time analysis decreases microgrid expenditure because it avoids grid penalisation regarding the energy autonomy index and reduces the degradation and maintenance of energy storage devices. Compared to a standard rule-based strategy, the proposed controller reduces annual costs up to 5% in residential buildings and 9% in non-residential ones. In contrast, compared to a conventional HMPC the annual expenditure is reduced from 1% to 7% in both types of buildings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The potential role of hydrogen as a tool for the decarbonization of the energy sector is widely recognized. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the marginal utility of increasing the hydrogen penetration on the energy and environmental performances of a multi-energy system is developed to assess its potential. A distributed energy system satisfying the energy requirements for an existing building is chosen as test case, assumed as representative of a wide set of applications. Starting from real energy consumption profiles, representative scenarios and optimized design configurations are defined using a methodology that takes into account uncertainties both in demand and renewable production profiles and in techno-economic parameters assumptions. For each multi energy system configuration, an optimal dispatch control strategy is achieved through a mixed-integer linear programming method to maximize the building self-independence from the grid. Results show how an increase of hydrogen technologies penetration allows a reduction of the specific carbon footprint of the system down to 100 grCO2/kWh while increasing the system resilience up to 85%. Detailed information about the marginal effect of H2 technologies on resilience, carbon footprint, and fossil energy savings are presented and can be used for extensions to similar applications. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Most inhabitants of rural communities in Africa lack access to clean and reliable electricity. This has deprived the rural dwellers access to modern healthcare delivery. In this paper, an off-grid renewable energy system consisting of solar PV and wind turbine with hydrogen storage scheme has been explored to meet the electrical energy demands of a health clinic. The health clinic proposed is a group II with 10 beds located in a typical village in South Africa. First, the wind and solar energy resources of the village were analysed. Thereafter, the microgrid architecture that would meet the energy demand of the clinic (18.67 kWh/day) was determined. Some of the key results reveal that the average annual wind speed at 60 m anemometer height and solar irradiation of the village are 7.9 m/s and 4.779 kWh/m2/day, respectively. The required architecture for the clinic composes of 40 kW solar PV system, 3 numbers of 10 kW wind turbines, 8.6 kW fuel cell, 25 kW electrolyser and 40 kg hydrogen tank capacity. The capital cost of the microgrid was found to be $177,600 with a net present cost of $206,323. The levelised cost of energy of the system was determined to be 2.34 $/kWh. The project has a breakeven grid extension distance of 8.81 km. Since this distance is less than the nearest grid extension distance of 21.35 km, it is established that the proposed renewable energy microgrid with a hydrogen storage system is a viable option for the rural community health clinic. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The development of inexpensive and efficient catalysts for ammonia electro-oxidation reaction (AOR) is essential to ammonia-based economy. In this paper, a self-supporting AOR catalyst of ultra-elongated defective TiO nanofibers grown on Ti foil (TiO/Ti foil) is designed. By the comparisons of electrochemical measurement results, the efficient AOR activity of TiO/Ti foil has been presented in alkaline ammonia solution when the voltage is higher than 0.4 V. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the surface oxygen vacancies in TiO play a vital role in facilitating AOR activity by reducing the energy barrier in the rate-determining ∗HNNH2 formation step and also promoting N2 desorption. These results demonstrate that defective TiO is a promising low-cost and stable catalyst for AOR, which is a potential electrode for efficient H2 production by ammonia electrolysis and direct ammonia fuel cells. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The proposed system consists of a nuclear reactor, a steam Rankine cycle, a hydrogen electrolyzer, a storage system for hydrogen in an underground salt cavern, and a Brayton cycle that uses hydrogen as fuel to generate additional electricity to meet peak demand. A dynamic mathematical model is developed for each subsystem of the NHES. To evaluate the potential benefits of the system, a one-year study is conducted, using scaled grid demand data from ISO New England. The dynamic simulation results show that the system is capable of meeting the demand of the grid without additional electricity from outside sources for 93% of the year, while decreasing the number of ramping cycles of the nuclear reactor by 92.7%. There is also potential for economic benefits as the system only had to ramp up and down 7.4% of the year, which increased the nuclear capacity factor from 86.3% to 98.3%. The simulation results show that the proposed hybrid system improves the flexibility of nuclear power plants, provides more electricity, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The EU Green Deal calls for climate neutrality by 2050 and emission reductions of 50–55% in 2030 in comparison to 1990. Achieving these reductions requires a substantial tightening of the regulations of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). This paper explores how the power sector would have to change in reaction to a tighter EU ETS target, and analyses the technological and economic implications. To cover the major ETS sectors, we combine a detailed power sector model with a marginal-abatement cost curve representation of industry emission abatement. We find that tightening the target would speed up the transformation by 3–17 years for different parts of the electricity system, with renewables contributing 74% of the electricity in 2030, EU-wide coal use almost completely phased-out by 2030 instead of 2045, and zero electricity generation emissions reached by 2040. Carbon prices within the EU ETS would more than triple to 129€/tCO2 in 2030, reducing cumulated power sector emissions from 2017 to 2057 by 54% compared to a scenario with the current target. This transformation would come at limited costs: total discounted power system costs would only increase by 5%. We test our findings against a number of sensitivities: an increased electricity demand, which might arise from sector coupling, increases deployment of wind and solar and prolongs gas usage. Not allowing transmission expansion beyond 2020 levels shifts investments from wind to PV, hydrogen and batteries, and increases total system costs by 3%. Finally, the unavailability of fossil carbon capture and storage (CCS) or further nuclear investments does not impact results. Unavailability of bioenergy-based CCS (BECCS) has a visible impact (18% increase) on cumulated power sector emissions, thus shifting more of the mitigation burden to the industry sector, but does not increase electricity prices or total system costs (<1% increase). © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Nowadays, there is a great demand for low-cost and highly active electrocatalyst for the production of clean renewable energy. However, most of the electrocatalysts are noble metal-based which are very costly and unstable. To counter this, electrochemical water splitting in energy storage systems is been widely applied, using non-noble metal-based nanostructured electrocatalysts. In this work, a novel noble metal-free MoSe2–Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite electrocatalyst is synthesized using a multi-step hydrothermal technique for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The morphology, structural, chemical composition, and functional features of the synthesized nanomaterials were characterized using different techniques that include scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Raman analysis. The new developed MoSe2–Ni(OH)2 nanocomposite combines a high active surface area with a high chemical stability, generating a novel material with a synergistic effect that enhances water splitting process performance. Thus, an outstanding low Tafel slope of 54 mV dec−1 is accomplished in the hydrogen evolution reaction. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The technologies aim, inter alia, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of renewable energy sources and take a step forward to the production of hydrogen as an alternative energy source in numerous applications. In view of the estimated demand for heat, electricity and hydrogen in the Savinja-Šalek region, Slovenia, the technologies to meet such demand are proposed in this article from a technical perspective. An energy and economic analysis of the operation of the Thermal Power Plant (TPP) will be done. The TPP is operating in a variable operating regime. The possibility of stationary operation of the power plant will be analysed, the surplus of produced electricity will be used for the hydrogen production. The process is based on the Rankine-Clausius cycle (RC) with dual superheating using water or steam as the working media. The idea in this article, is to generate in the above mentioned facility as much hydrogen, heat, cold and electricity as needed by the Savinja-Šalek region in industry, transport, etc. Thus, the power plant could operate optimally, constantly at 100% of power, which would allow simultaneous production of electricity, heat and hydrogen. Hydrogen could be used for sale on the market or for the electricity production or for heating. Hydrogen could be produced via electrolysis or thermochemical process. In the second part of article, the analysis of RC with concentrated solar energy and wood chips was analysed. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is an important energy carrier in the transportation sector and an essential industrial feedstock for petroleum refineries, methanol, and ammonia production. Renewable energy sources, especially solar energy have been investigated for large-scale hydrogen production in thermochemical, electrochemical, or photochemical manners due to considerable greenhouse gas emissions from the conventional steam reforming of natural gas and oil-based feedstock. The solar steam methane reforming using molten salt (SSMR-MS) is superior due to its unlimited operation hours and lower total annualized cost (TAC). In this work, we extend the existing optimisation framework for optimal design of SSMR-MS in which machine learning techniques are employed to describe the relationship between solar-related cost and molten salt heat duty and establish relationships of TAC, hydrogen production rate and molten salt heat duty with independent input variables in the whole flowsheet based on 18,619 sample points generated using the Latin hypercube sampling technique. A hybrid global optimisation algorithm is adopted to optimise the developed model and generate the optimal design, which is validated in SAM and Aspen Plus V8.8. The computational results demonstrate that a significant reduction in TAC by 14.9 % ~ 15.1 %, and CO2 emissions by 4.4 % ~ 5.2 % can be achieved compared to the existing SSMR-MS. The lowest Levelized cost of Hydrogen Production is 2.4 $ kg−1 which is reduced by around 17.2 % compared to the existing process with levelized cost of 2.9 $ kg−1. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, public attention has been increasingly attracted to solving two inextricably linked problems - preventing the depletion of natural resources and protecting the environment from anthropogenic pollution. The annual consumption of livestock waste for biogas production is about 240 thousand m3 per year, which is 0.17% of the total manure produced at Russian agricultural enterprises. At present, the actual use of organic waste potentially suitable for biogas production is 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than the existing potential for organic waste. Currently, hydrogen energy is gaining immense popularity in the world due to the problem of depletion of non-renewable energy sources - hydrocarbons, and environmental pollution caused by their increasing consumption. Of particular interest is the dark process of producing hydrogen-containing biogas in the processing of organic waste under anaerobic conditions, which allows you to take advantage of both energy production and solving the problem of organic waste disposal. An energy analysis of a two-stage anaerobic liquid organic waste processing system with the production of hydrogen- and methane-containing biogases based on experimental data obtained in a laboratory plant with increased volume reactors was performed. The energy efficiency of the system is in the range of 1.91–2.74. Maximum energy efficiency was observed with a hydraulic retention time of 2.5 days in a dark fermentation reactor. The cost of electricity to produce 1 m3 of hydrogen was 1.093 kW·h with a hydraulic retention time of 2.5 days in the dark fermentation reactor. When the hydraulic retention time in the dark fermentation reactor was 1 day, the specific (in ratio to the processing rate of organic waste) energy costs to produce of 1 m3 of hydrogen were minimal in the considered hrt range, and amounted to 26 (W/m3 of hydrogen)/(m3 of waste/day). Thus, the system of two-stage anaerobic processing of liquid organic waste to produce hydrogen and methane-containing biogases is an energy-efficient way to both produce hydrogen and process organic waste. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production is the key in utilizing an excess renewable energy. Many studies and projects looked at the energy management systems (EMSs) that allow to couple hydrogen production with renewable generation. In the majority of these studies, however, hydrogen demand is either produced for powering fuel cells or sold to the external hydrogen market. Hydrogen demand from actual industrial plants is rarely considered. In this paper, we propose an EMS based on the industrial cluster of GreenLab Skive (GLS) that can minimize the system's operational cost or maximize its green hydrogen production. EMS utilizes a conventional and P2X demand response (DR) flexibility from electrolysis plant, hydrogen storage tank, electric battery, and hydrogen-consuming plants to design the optimal schedule with maximized benefits. A potential addition to the existing components at GLS - an ammonia plant is modelled to identify its P2X potential and assess the economic viability of its construction. The results show a potential reduction of 51.5–61.6% for the total operational cost of the system and an increase of the share of green hydrogen by 10.4–37.6% due to EMS operation. © 2021 The Author(s)},

The two green urea production processes are evaluated techno-economically and compared with state-of-the-art methane-to-urea. The results show that the methane-to-urea achieves a system efficiency of 58% (LHV), while biomass-to-urea only has 39% (LHV) with unconverted biomass carbon of up to 60%. The integrated power- and biomass-to-urea has outstanding heat integration performance which fixes all biomass carbon into urea, with an efficiency enhanced up to 53%. Due to the electricity demand, the levelized cost of the urea of integrated biomass- and power-to-urea is 15 – 38 and 58 – 87% points higher than those of the biomass-to-urea and methane-to-urea for the scale of 10 – 60 MWth urea production. The available annual hours and electricity price of renewable electricity have a significant impact on the levelized cost of the urea. When the available annual hours decrease from 7200 to 3600 with an electricity price of 73 $/MWh, the levelized cost of urea increases on average by 13% from 51 $/GJ with the plant capacity being 10 – 60 MWth urea. However, when electricity price is reduced from 73 $/MWh to 35 $/MWh with available annual hours of 3600, the levelized cost decreases on average by 15% from 59 $/GJ with the same plant capacity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents extensive insights on the value of applying demand response (DR) in a system perspective against the background of two strongly contrasting decarbonization pathways for a decentralized and centralized European energy system with a 100% renewable share and sector coupling. The pathways are characterized by structural differences concerning the combination of installed renewable capacities, the acceptance for activated demand response potentials and different electricity, heat and hydrogen demands. The objective is to determine the potential role of demand response and its impact on the optimal combinations of flexibility options in a decentralized vs. centralized scenario framework model-endogenously. Therefore, openly available data and hourly time series of country-specific demand response potentials are implemented into a large-scale linear optimization model. Sensitivities concerning varying shares of demand response availability are used to identify main influencing factors on selected components of the electricity system such as the capacity and generation mix, storage requirements, renewable integration and their market value factors, CO2 emissions and total system costs. Model results show a higher reduction of total system costs and CO2 emissions per activated demand response unit in the photovoltaic dominated decentralized scenario (–55 MEUR/GWDR, –0.045 MtCO2/GWDR), compared to the wind dominated centralized scenario (–39 MEUR/GWDR, –0.037 MtCO2/GWDR). The outcomes conclude that the daily photovoltaic feed-in characteristics have a higher correlation with the time pattern of load shifting and shedding demand response appliances than wind feed-in characteristics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

To face a variety of ancillary services, hybrid storage systems are often grouped together forming a larger energy and power densities storage system. However, to healthily coordinated schedule the grouped hybrid storages is still a problem. In this paper, a three-stage combined algorithm is proposed to cooperate the grouped hybrid storage systems: first, multi-criteria decision making is adopted to allocate expected power to each hybrid storage system; second, model predictive control (MPC) associated with support vector machine and Kalman filter is used to dispatch the allocated power to hydrogen storage and battery; third, a PID controller is deployed for reference tracking. Simulation results show that prediction errors in MPC cause the increases of operation cost and degradation index. For the operation cost, the combined fuzzy membership and MPC-Kalman filter algorithm has a better performance. The PID controller has a good ability to track reference signals. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Hence, its regional and global hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) are vital for the potential future energy markets. We present a holistic study of various options for transporting (not producing) hydrogen from both techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The infrastructure and energy requirements of four options for transporting hydrogen between export and import terminals, namely methyl cyclohexane, liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen, and liquid ammonia, are analyzed in detail. These are compared for HSC energy penalty, carbon avoidance and landed cost of hydrogen under different scenarios. A case study is also presented to capture the perspectives of an importer. The preferred transport mode depends on export location and end use.

	abstract = {The energy supply system of Uzbekistan is not well positioned to meet the rapidly rising domestic energy demand of this country. Uzbekistan's current energy supply system is outdated and has very low diversity, as most of its energy comes from natural gas. In addition to producing immense amounts of greenhouse gas and environmental pollution, this situation is untenable considering the eventual depletion of fossil fuel reserves of this country. Uzbekistan's renewable energy sector is highly undeveloped, a situation that can be attributed to the lack of coherent policies for the advancement of renewable power and the low price of natural gas. However, this country has significant untapped renewable potentials, especially wind energy, that can perform a significant performance in the country's power generation plans. Also, producing hydrogen from renewable power can provide a good alternative to fossil fuels and help meet the needs of the Uzbek industrial sector, especially oil, gas, and petrochemical industries. In this study, the suitability of 17 regions in Uzbekistan for wind-powered hydrogen production was analyzed in terms of 16 sub-criteria in four categories of technical, economic, social, and environmental factors. To obtain robust results, the ranking was performed using a hybrid of BWM and EDAS, as well as WASPAS, ARAS, and WSM techniques. The weighting results exhibited the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH), and Annual Energy Production (AEP) to be the most important sub-criteria for this evaluation. Nukus, Buhara, and Kungrad were introduced as the top three most appropriate locations for hydrogen development from wind plants. It was estimated that using 2000 kW turbines, a wind-powered hydrogen production plant built in the Nukus region can achieve an annual power output of 4432.7 MW and annual hydrogen output of 71.752 tons. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green ammonia production as an important application for propelling the upcoming hydrogen economy has not been paid much attention by China, the world's largest ammonia producer. As a result, related studies are limited. This paper explores potential supply chain design and planning strategies of green ammonia production in the next decade of China with a case study in Inner Mongolia. A hybrid optimization-based simulation approach is applied, considering traditional optimization approaches are insufficient to address uncertainties and dynamics in a long-term energy transition. Results show that the production cost of green ammonia will be at least twice that of the current level due to higher costs of hydrogen supply. Production accounts for the largest share of the total expense of green hydrogen (~80 %). The decline of electricity and electrolyser prices are key in driving down the overall costs. In addition, by-product oxygen is also considered in the model to assess its economic benefits. We found that by-product oxygen sales could partly reduce the total expense of green hydrogen (~12 % at a price of USD 85/t), but it also should be noted that the volatile price of oxygen may pose uncertainties and risks to the effectiveness of the offset. Since the case study may represent the favourable conditions in China due to the abundant renewable energy resources and large-scale ammonia industry in this region, we propose to take a moderate step towards green ammonia production, and policies should be focused on reducing the electricity price and capital investments in green hydrogen production. We assume the findings and implications are informative to planning future green ammonia production in China. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Hybrid solar photovoltaic and wind turbine systems are developed for power supply to the diversified community integrated with three hydrogen vehicle storage groups based on the TRNSYS platform. An individual peer energy trading price model is proposed for the diversified community to allocate an individual peer trading price to each building group according to its intrinsic energy characteristic and grid import price. The time-of-use peer trading management strategies are further developed for both uniform and individual energy trading price modes to improve the grid flexibility and economy. The study results indicate that the peer energy trading management in the individual trading price mode improves the renewable energy self-consumption ratio by 18.76% and load cover ratio by 11.23% for the net-zero energy community compared with the peer-to-grid trading. The time-of-use trading management in the individual trading price mode can reduce the net grid import energy by 8.93%, grid penalty cost by 142.87%, annual electricity cost by 14.54%, and equivalent carbon emissions by 8.93% (982.36 tCO2), respectively.

For the successful application of hydrogen-based renewable energy such as fuel cells, highly active and cost-saving metallic electro-catalysts for H2 fuel production are vital. The goal of this study is to look into the effects of alloyed molybdenum, chromium, and iron on the electrocatalytic activity of Ni-based alloys in an alkaline electrolyte for HER. SEM with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) unit was used to determine the chemical composition of alloys. The electrocatalytic effectiveness of the explored cathodes on HER was evaluated in alkaline solutions employing open circuit potential measurements, linear polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The impact of KOH concentrations on HER rate was also investigated. Tafel curves were used to calculate the HER's kinetic parameters, and the mechanisms of the HER were discovered. EIS observations at HER's cathodic potential have been explored and compared to a theoretical model. The Ni–Cr–Mo–Fe alloy has a low over-potential of 232 mV @ 10 mA cm−2 and a Tafel slope of 57.7 mV dec−1 in 1.0 M KOH media, resulting in an efficient HER. These findings indicate that the addition of Mo and Fe to Ni–Cr improves the catalytic efficiency of HER significantly.

The objective functions are maximizing the reliability and minimizing both the operation cost and the gap between the energy consumption and its optimal value. The participation of the RCs is modeled through the demand shifting strategy and the local generation of the plug-in electric vehicles. To model the uncertainties of the renewable energy sources and the demand, the Monte Carlo simulation approach is used. The resulted model is solved using the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) regarding which the non-dominated solutions are generated. Then, the best solution is obtained using the fuzzy and the weighted sum methods. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed model, it is applied on a 24-node test system through defining four case studies. The results shown that in the presence of the RCs and the HSS, the operation cost and the reliability of the system both improve. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydropower compounds most of the energy matrix of the countries of the Latin America and Caribbean region (LAC). Considering the concern in reducing Green House Gases emissions (GHG) from hydropower plants and hydrogen production from fossil sources, green hydrogen (H2) appears as an energy vector able to mitigate this impact. Improving the efficiency of the plant and producing renewable energy the element is an interesting alternative from the ecological and economic point of view. This study aims to estimate the potential of H2 production from wasted energy, through the electrolysis of water in hydroelectric plants in Colombia and Venezuela. The construction of two scenarios allowed obtaining a difference, considering a spilled flow of 2/3 in the first scenario and 1/3 in the second. In Colombia, hydrogen production reached 3.39 E+08 Nm3 at a cost of 2.05 E+05 USD/kWh in scenario1, and 1.70 E+08 Nm3 costing 4.10 E+05 USD/kWh in scenario 2. Regarding the Venezuelan context, the country obtained lower production values of H2, ranging between 7.76 E+07 Nm3.d−1 and 4.31 E+07 Nm3.d−1, and production cost between 9.45 E+09 USD/kWh and 1.89 E+10 USD/kWh. Thus, the final cost for the production and storage of H2 was estimated at 0.2239 USD.kg−1. Ultimately, Colombia and Venezuela have a large potential to supply the demand for nitrogen fertilizers with green ammonia production, apply green hydrogen in manufacturing and use the surplus for energy substitution of Liquefied Petroleum Gas - LPG. In Colombia, the chemical energy offered is equivalent to 6.681 E+11 MJ/year−1 and in Venezuela, the result is equal to 1.697 E+11 MJ/year−1 in the conservative scenario. Finally, the countries have great potential for the diversification of the energy matrix and the insertion of renewables in the system. © 2021},

	abstract = {Herein, we developed an integrated process for H2 recovery and CO2 capture from the tail gas of hydrogen plants. The front-sector system (cryogenic, membrane, and compressor units) involved CO2 capture and supply of H2-rich gas to the rear-sector system (heat exchanger (HX) and pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit) for H2 recovery. The developed dynamic model of the integrated process was validated through reference data. The parametric study highlighted the potential of the developed process for high-purity H2 recovery and CO2 capture. Owing to the complexity of the interconnections, a dynamic-model-based artificial neural network (ANN) for the integrated process was developed to optimize the process performance. The synthetic datasets for the ANN were analyzed by singular value decomposition, and the ANN models for the cryogenic, membrane, and PSA units were trained and tested within a marginal error (<2%). Subsequently, a process-driven model (the integration of the ANN models with the algebraic equations (compressor, HX, and economic evaluation)) was validated through minute deviations from the reference data. The optimization, formulated based on the process-driven model, was conducted using differential evolution. The optimum cost (2.045 $/kg) of recovered H2 (99.99%) was economically comparable to the reference values for H2 production from natural gas. Furthermore, the cost was covered for 91% CO2 capture with 98.6 vol.% CO2. Thus, the result can bridge the gaps in research, development, and implementation and between fossil and renewable energy. Dynamic-model-based ANN can precisely predict the dynamic behavior and optimum performance of an integrated process at a low computational cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The current focus on the massive CO2 reduction highlights the need for the rapid development of technology for the production, storage, transportation and distribution of renewable energy. In addition to electricity, we need other forms of energy carriers that are more suitable for energy storage and transportation. Hydrogen is one of the main candidates for this purpose, since it can be produced from solar or wind energy and then stored; once needed, it can be converted back to electricity using fuel cells. Another important aspect of future energy systems is sector coupling, where different sectors, e.g. mobility and energy, work together to provide better services. In such an integrated system, electric vehicles – both battery and hydrogen-based fuel cell – can provide, when parked, electricity services, such as backup power and balancing; when driving they produce no emissions. In this paper we present the concept design and energy management of such an integrated energy and mobility system in a real-life environment at the Shell Technology Centre in Amsterdam. Our results show that storage using hydrogen and salt caverns is much cheaper than using large battery storage systems. We also show that the integration of electric vehicles into the electricity network is technically and economically feasible and that they can provide a flexible energy buffer. Ultimately, the results of this study show that using both electricity and hydrogen as energy carriers can create a more flexible, reliable and cheaper energy system at an office building. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) has been considered as the promising non-noble metal electrocatalyst for the hydrogen production via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through water splitting. The nanostructured nitrogen (N) incorporated carbon (C) coupled with Mo2C is the potential candidate to boost the HER activity and electrode material for the energy conversion applications. In this work, nitrogen incorporated carbon coated Mo2C (Mo2C@C/N) has been synthesized in an eco-friendly way using waste plastic as the carbon source. The pure phase Mo2C@C/N has been synthesized at 700 and 800 °C for 10 h. The relatively higher temperature synthesized phase shows enhanced HER activity with lower Tafel slope (72.9 mVdec−1) and overpotential of 186.6 mV to drive current density of 10 mAcm−2. It also exhibits stability up to 2000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles and retains the current density with negligible loss for 10 h.

An electrolyser is a device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. When electricity is produced from renewable energy sources, electrolytic hydrogen can be considered to be green. At the same time, electrolysers can help integrate renewable electricity into power systems, as their electricity consumption can be adjusted to follow wind and solar power generation. Green hydrogen then also becomes a carrier for renewable electricity. Key green hydrogen production technologies, mostly PEM and alkaline electrolysers, are still further maturing, both in technical (efficiency), economical (CAPEX) and durability (lifetime) performance. Nonetheless, we will show in this contribution how fossil parity for green hydrogen, i.e. a Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) similar to grey H2 coming from todays CO2 intensive SMR processes, can already be achieved today. Moreover, this can be realised at a scale which corresponds to the basic units of renewable electricity generation, i.e. a few MW. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) is regarded as a promising approach to achieve seasonal energy storage in the future, due to its synergy with surplus renewable energy generation. This paper proposes the idea of implementing an Integrated Energy System (IES) with UHS and other hydrogen related technologies, called Hydrogen Penetrated Energy System (HPES), and presents an intelligent planning procedure applicable to the HPES. Depleted oil/gas fields and salt caverns are selected as the study objects to explore the ability of UHS to achieve seasonal peak shaving, facilitate the renewable energy, and improve the energy system efficiency. Firstly, three regions in China are analysed in terms of geological conditions, resource endowment and load characteristics, to illustrate the feasibility of building a HPES in each of the analysed region. A two-stage planning method for the HPES is proposed and a detailed UHS model is established where the process of cushion gas accumulation is emulated and the influence of the diurnal temperature range is considered. Comprehensive case studies are subsequently carried out for typical cities or regions in Eastern, Northern and North-eastern China and the results demonstrate that the HPES can lower the cost, improve the energy efficiency and reduce the level of carbon dioxide emission to some extent. A lateral comparison also shows that the combination of salt cavern UHS and offshore wind power has a broad application prospect in the east coast of China, and the investment in the HPES scheme for Jintan can be recovered within 8 to 9 years. In addition, compared with the benchmark scheme without UHS and large penetration of renewables, the HPES scheme for Jintan can improve the primary energy efficiency by 22.26% and 27.75% in the first decade and second decade, reduce the carbon dioxide emission by more than 96%, and consume an average level of 95.85% of the offshore wind power. Although the investment payback period of HPES cases in north and northwest China is relatively long (20 years or more), significant return and benefits can be obtained in the long term. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

We consider hydrogen production based on several feedstocks and energy sources, namely water with electricity, natural gas and biomass. When using natural gas, we couple hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage. The design of the hydrogen, biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) infrastructure is performed by solving an optimization problem that determines the optimal selection, size and location of the hydrogen production technologies, and the optimal structure of the hydrogen, biomass and CO2 networks. First, we investigate the rationale behind the optimal design of low-carbon hydrogen supply chains by referring to an idealized system configuration and by performing a parametric analysis of the most relevant design parameters of the supply chains, such as biomass availability. This allows drawing general conclusions, independent of any specific geographic features, about the minimum-cost and minimum-emissions system designs and network structures. Moreover, we analyze the Swiss case study to derive specific guidelines concerning the design of hydrogen supply chains deploying carbon capture and storage. We assess the impact of relevant design parameters, such as location of CO2 storage facilities, techno-economic features of CO2 capture technologies, and network losses, on the optimal supply chain design and on the competition between the hydrogen and CO2 networks. Findings highlight the fundamental role of biomass (when available) and of carbon capture and storage for decarbonizing hydrogen supply chains while transitioning to a wider deployment of renewable energy sources. © 2020 The Authors},

Hydrogen has the potential to play a key role through its versatile production methods, end uses and as a storage medium for renewable energy, engendering the future low-carbon energy system. This research uses a global model cognizant of energy policy, technology learning curves and international carbon reduction targets to optimize the future energy system in terms of cost and carbon emissions to the year 2050. Exploring combinations of four exploratory scenarios incorporating hydrogen city gas blend levels, nuclear restrictions, regional emission reduction obligations and carbon capture and storage deployment timelines, it was identified that hydrogen has the potential to supply approximately two percent of global energy needs by 2050. Irrespective of the quantity of hydrogen produced, the transport sector and passenger fuel cell vehicles are consistently a preferential end use for future hydrogen across regions and modeled scenarios. In addition to the potential contribution of hydrogen, a shift toward renewable energy and a significant role for carbon capture and storage is identified to underpin carbon target achievement by 2050. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {There has been growing interest in the development of sustainable energy systems using the potential of renewable energy sources. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, they must be accompanied by appropriate storage devices to be optimally integrated into so-called smart micro-grid systems. The optimal design problem of sustainable micro-grids is associated with several nonlinearities and non-convexities, and therefore is not amenable to exact methods of optimization. Accordingly, this paper proposes a metaheuristic-based approach for optimizing the size and typology of the components of an off-grid hydrogen-based micro-grid, backed up with super-capacitors and stationary fuel cell systems, in the presence of a hydrogen refuelling station. The paper also compares the performance of six recent metaheuristics. The simulations are carried out for the climatic conditions of the Feilding area, New Zealand using MATLAB. Based on the comparative results, the moth-flame optimization algorithm is found to result in a significant reduction in the total net present cost of the system in comparison with other investigated algorithms. Notably, it outperforms the genetic algorithm and the particle swarm optimization in terms of solution quality by ~2.1% and ~3.2% (equating to cost savings of $123,910 and $188,129 from the target system). The results also demonstrate both the technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the proposed stand-alone micro-grid architecture. Particularly, the levelized costs of electricity and hydrogen of the conceptualized system are found to be $0.09/kWh and $4.61/kg, respectively, which are well below the current tariffs in New Zealand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

In addition to partly allowing a further utilization of the existing gas infrastructure for energy transport and storage, hydrogen or synthetic natural gas (SNG) from electric power represents a high-density energy carrier and important feedstock material for further processing. This premise leads to a significant demand for large-scale PtG plants, which was evaluated with an amount of up to 4530 GWel for electrolysis and up to 1360 GWSNG for methanation capacities at a global scale. Together with the upscaling of single-MW plants available today, this will enable to achieve appropriate cost reduction effects through technological learning. Under given scenarios, reduction potentials for CAPEX of >75% are expected for multi-MW PtG plants in the long-term, with significant advantages of PEM and solid oxide electrolysis over alkaline systems in the short- and mid-term. The resulting effects on PtG product costs were evaluated via a holistic techno-economic assessment, resulting in SNG production costs of 15 €-cent/kWh and below for large-scale appliances in 2050, depending on the renewable electricity supply. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study analyzes the factors leading to the deployment of Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH2) within the optimal design of district-scale Multi-Energy Systems (MES). To this end, we utilize an optimization framework based on a mixed integer linear program that selects, sizes, and operates technologies in the MES to satisfy electric and thermal demands, while minimizing annual costs and CO2 emissions. We conduct a comprehensive uncertainty analysis that encompasses the entire set of technology (e.g. cost, efficiency, lifetime) and context (e.g. economic, policy, grid carbon footprint) input parameters, as well as various climate-referenced districts (e.g. environmental data and energy demands) at a European-scope. Minimum-emissions MES, with large amounts of renewable energy generation and high ratios of seasonal thermal-to-electrical demand, optimally achieve zero operational CO2 emissions by utilizing PtH2 seasonally to offset the long-term mismatch between renewable generation and energy demand. PtH2 is only used to abate the last 5–10% emissions, and it is installed along with a large battery capacity to maximize renewable self-consumption and completely electrify thermal demand with heat pumps and fuel cells. However, this incurs additional cost. Additionally, we show that ‘traditional’ MES comprised of renewables and short-term energy storage are able to decrease emissions by 90% with manageable cost increases. The impact of uncertainty on the optimal system design reveals that the most influential parameter for PtH2 implementation is (1) heat pump efficiency as it is the main competitor in providing renewable-powered heat in winter. Further, battery (2) capital cost and (3) lifetime prove to be significant as the competing electrical energy storage technology. In the face of policy uncertainties, a CO2 tax shows large potential to reduce emissions in district MES without cost implications. The results illustrate the importance of capturing the dynamics and uncertainties of short- and long-term energy storage technologies for assessing cost and CO2 emissions in optimal MES designs over districts with different geographical scopes. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {As a clean and renewable energy, hydrogen has attracted increasing attention for the replacement of fossil fuels because it is an emerging way to address the uncertainties of the renewable energy. Besides, coordination of the energy storage units, such as hydrogen storage unit, hot water storage unit and chilled water storage unit, could improve energy efficiency and reduce system cost. Thus, the optimal planning of a distributed hydrogen-based multi-energy system is very important to build a hydrogen-based distributed energy system in the demand side. This paper focuses on the system planning problem, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem and the objective is to minimize annual capital and operation expenditure of the system. The problem is solved by a commercial solver. The case studies are performed under different energy demand profiles and solar radiations obtained by EnergyPlus in twelve typical cities around the world. It is found that multi-energy storage units in the systems can significantly reduce system capital expenditure and operating expenses. Hot water storage unit enjoys the best benefits with an average system cost reduction rate being 64.6% with the planning horizon (8760 h). And the DHME system is environmental friendly, which can even drop over 100% carbon emission in high solar radiation regions compared with the conventional electricity-driven energy system. Furthermore, with optimistic hydrogen price target of USA Department of Energy, the developed DHME system will maximum reduce 60.0% OPEX compared with the conventional electricity-driven energy system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The production of hydrogen is ensured by an alkaline water electrolyser supplied by the electric current generated by the renewable energy sources. The study is carried out on the basis of meteorological data from the Tangier region, in Morocco. Mathematical models are developed to assess the performance and efficiency of renewable sources in terms of energy and hydrogen production for different installed powers. The comparison between the current results and those of previous work shows that the discrepancy did not exceed 6% for both electrical and thermal efficiency of the concentrated photovoltaic/thermal system. The results show that the energy consumption ratios of the electrolyzer are 61 and 64 kWh.kg−1 for wind and solar energy, respectively. Wind and solar hydrogen production efficiencies are also 66 and 62%, respectively. Results show that levelized costs of energy and hydrogen decrease with the increase in installed wind and photovoltaic capacity. The overall results also show that the Tangier region can produce energy and hydrogen at low cost using wind energy compared to concentrated photovoltaic installations. For the hybridization of the two green sources studied, this is highly recommended provided that the capacity of the electrolyzer to be installed is optimal in order to effectively improve the production of hydrogen. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Even though economic dispatch of integrated electricity and natural gas systems using optimization techniques has been widely conducted, a cooperative distributed and multi-objective optimization is still needed for meeting multi-energy demands from both conventional and renewable energy resources. In this study, an original bi-level economic-environmental equilibrium model is proposed to optimize a dispatch strategy for an integrated system, which include combined cooling, heating, and power and power to gas technologies. By optimizing cooperative distributed decisions, the system attempts to provide heat/cooling, power and natural gas loads. An equilibrium consideration of economic energy supply and environmental carbon emission control is achieved using a multi-objective optimization in the model. To reflect interactions of individual system operators in a cooperative distributed manner, a bi-level optimization is applied to address the respective decisions and objective functions. Subsequently, an interactive solution approach based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II and genetic algorithm is specifically designed to solve the model by updating individual decisions interactively and iteratively, and the optimality of an integrated solution lies in the capability to coordinate two system operators for a reliable, economic and environmental energy supply. Performance of the dispatch strategy is validated for a case with various system configurations. The obtained results showed that multi-energy needs are met, economic-environmental trade-offs achieved and hierarchical interactions addressed. Proper managerial suggestions are also provided based on comparison analyses. The proposed method is therefore worthy of being popularized in integrated systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Energy storage technologies ensure a balance between demand and supply and increase the system flexibility. This study investigates increased application of renewable energy resources at a regional scale. Power-to-gas storage that interacts with a large-scale rooftop photovoltaic system is added to a regional energy system dominated by combined heat and power plants. The study addresses the influence of the storage system on the production planning of the combined heat and power plants and the system flexibility. The system is modeled and the product costs are optimized using the Mixed Integer Linear Programming method, as well as considering the effects on CO2 emissions and power import into the regional system. The optimization model is investigated by developing different scenarios for the capacity and cost of the storage system. The results indicate that the proposed storage system increases the system flexibility and can reduce power imports and the marginal emissions by around 53%, compared with the current energy system. There is a potential to convert a large amount of excess power to hydrogen and store it in the system. However, because of low efficiency, a fuel cell cannot significantly contribute to power regeneration from the stored hydrogen. Therefore, for about 70% of the year, the power is imported to the optimized system to compensate the power shortfalls rather than to use the fuel cell. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Hydrogen evolution through photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting by tungsten oxide-based photoanodes, as a stable and environmental-friendly material with moderate band gap, has attracted significant interest in recent years. The performance of WO3 photoanode could be hindered by its poor oxygen evolution reaction kinetics and high charge carrier recombination rate. Additionally, scalable and cost-effective commercial procedure to prepare nanostructured electrodes is still challenging. We present, for the first time, a novel and scalable method to fabricate highly efficient self-supported WO3/W nanostructured photoanodes from commercial W–Cu powder metallurgy (P/M) parts for water splitting. The electrodes were prepared by electrochemical etching of Cu networks followed by hydrothermal growth of WO3 nanoflakes. Interconnected channels of W skeleton provided high active surface area for the growth of WO3 nanoflakes with a thickness of ~40 nm and lateral dimension of ~250 nm. The optimized photoelectrode having 35% interconnected porosity exhibited an impressive current density of 4.36 mA cm−2 comprising a remarkable photocurrent of 1.71 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE under 100 mW cm−2 simulated sunlight. This achievement is amongst the highest reported photocurrents for WO3 photoelectrodes with tungsten substrate reported so far. Impedance and Mott-Schottky analyses evidenced fast charge transfer, low recombination rate, and accelerated O2 detachment provided by optimum 3D porous WO3/W electrode. Due to the nature of the commercial P/M parts and low-temperature hydrothermal processing, the procedure is cost-effective and scalable which can pave a new route for the fabrication of highly porous and efficient water splitting electrodes. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The identification of site location is one of the critical tasks in developing or expanding any supply chain system including the construction of renewable power generation plants. The accurate identification of a plant site can considerably reduce unforeseen risks and costs and also raise productivity and efficacy. As such, this study sought to thoroughly evaluate all capital cities of a developing country for the establishment of a hybrid wind/solar power plant to produce hydrogen while considering the most influential and conflicting criteria. For this, 14 criteria including daily solar radiation, wind power density, clearness index, altitude, population, average sunny hours in a year, unemployment rate, average air temperature, average air humidity, average yearly precipitation, natural disasters, the distance between the site and the main road, average dusty days per year, and land price constituted the set of vital factors. To prioritize alternatives, a Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach named FVIKOR (Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution) was used. The results indicated that among 31 capital cities, the city of Yazd with a wind power density of 309.5 W/m2 and daily solar radiation of 5.4 kWh/m2 would be the best location for the purpose of this study. To validate the findings, FTOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was utilized and it also ranked Yazd as the first option. Then, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to discern the behavior of each criterion and their impact on the ranking of the cities. Finally, for hydrogen generation, an autonomous hybrid wind/solar system was techno-economically assessed using HOMER software. According to the analysis outcome, the proposed system showed a payback period of 7 years with levelized cost of 4.75 $/kg for hydrogen. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Yet, the expansion of renewable energy, especially the highly fluctuating production of wind energy, poses economic challenges to the existing energy system in Denmark. This paper investigates the economic feasibility of integrating a 250 kW, 500 kW, 750 kW and 1 MW water electrolysis system in the existing Danish energy market to exploit excessive off- and onshore wind energy for hydrogen production used as fuel for transportation purposes. In 2018, Danish wind turbines produced excess energy during 1238 h, which poses a capacity constraint as the electrolysis systems are limited to only produce hydrogen for 14% of the total available annual hours. This paper concludes that the net present value of each investment is negative as the fixed and variable production costs exceeds the generated revenues and it is therefore not economical feasible to invest in an electrolysis system with the purpose of only operating whenever excess off- and onshore wind energy is available. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of variable renewable energies poses new challenges for grid management. The economic feasibility of grid-balancing plants may be limited by low annual operating hours if they work either only for power generation or only for power storage. This issue might be addressed by a dual-function power plant with power-to-x capability, which can produce electricity or store excess renewable electricity into chemicals at different periods. Such a plant can be uniquely enabled by a solid-oxide cell stack, which can switch between fuel cell and electrolysis with the same stack. This paper investigates the optimal conceptual design of this type of plant, represented by power-to-x-to-power process chains with x being hydrogen, syngas, methane, methanol and ammonia, concerning the efficiency (on a lower heating value) and power densities. The results show that an increase in current density leads to an increased oxygen flow rate and a decreased reactant utilization at the stack level for its thermal management, and an increased power density and a decreased efficiency at the system level. The power-generation efficiency is ranked as methane (65.9%), methanol (60.2%), ammonia (58.2%), hydrogen (58.3%), syngas (53.3%) at 0.4 A/cm2, due to the benefit of heat-to-chemical-energy conversion by chemical reformulating and the deterioration of electrochemical performance by the dilution of hydrogen. The power-storage efficiency is ranked as syngas (80%), hydrogen (74%), methane (72%), methanol (68%), ammonia (66%) at 0.7 A/cm2, mainly due to the benefit of co-electrolysis and the chemical energy loss occurring in the chemical synthesis reactions. The lost chemical energy improves plant-wise heat integration and compensates for its adverse effect on power-storage efficiency. Combining these efficiency numbers of the two modes results in a rank of round-trip efficiency: methane (47.5%) > syngas (43.3%) ≈ hydrogen (42.6%) > methanol (40.7%) > ammonia (38.6%). The pool of plant designs obtained lays the basis for the optimal deployment of this balancing technology for specific applications. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The adoption of new environmentally responsible technologies, as well as, energy efficiency improvements in equipment and processes help to reduce CO2 rate emission into the atmosphere, contributing in delaying the consequences of intensive use of fossil fuels. For more effective actions, it is necessary to make the transition from the fossil-based to the renewable source economy. In this context, hydrogen fuel has a special role as clean vector of energy. Hydrogen has the potential to be decisive in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, but fossil fuels high profitability due to global energy dependency actually drives the global economy. While renewable energy sources are not worldwide fully established, new technologies should be developed and used for the recovery of energetic streams nowadays wasted, to decarbonize hydrocarbons and to improve systems efficiency creating a path that can help nations and industries in the needed energy economy transition. Hydrogen gas can be generated by various methods from different sources such as coal and water. Currently, almost all of the hydrogen production is for industrial purpose and comes from the Steam Reforming, while the use of hydrogen in fuel cells is only incipient. The article analysis the plasma pyrolysis of hydrocarbons as a decarbonization option to contribute as a step towards hydrogen economy. It presents the Carbon Black and Hydrogen Process (CB&H Process) as an alternative option for hydrogen generation at large scale facility, suitable for supplying large amounts of high-purity carbon in elemental form. CB&H Process refers to a plant with hydrogen thermal plasma reactor able to decompose Hydrocarbons (HC's) into Hydrogen (H2) and Carbon Black (CB), a cleaner technology than its competing processes, capable of generating two products with high added value. Considering the Brazilian context in which more than 80% of the generated electricity comes from renewable sources, the use of electricity as one of the inputs in the process does not compromise the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is important to consider that the use of renewable energy to produce two products derived from fossil fuels in a clean way represents integration of technologies into a more efficient system and an arrangement that contributes to the transition from fossil fuels to renewables. The economic viability of the CB&H process as a hydrogen generation unit (centralized) for refining applications also depends on the cost of hydrogen production by competing processes. Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) is a widespread method that produces twice the amount of hydrogen generated by natural gas plasma pyrolysis, but it emits CO2 gas and consumes water, while CB&H process produces solid carbon. For this reason, the paper seeks the carbon production cost by plasma pyrolysis as a breakeven point for large-scale hydrogen generation without water consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The hydrogen economy is currently experiencing a surge in attention, partly due to the possibility of absorbing variable renewable energy (VRE) production peaks through electrolysis. A fundamental challenge with this approach is low utilization rates of various parts of the integrated electricity-hydrogen system. To assess the importance of capacity utilization, this paper introduces a novel stylized numerical energy system model incorporating the major elements of electricity and hydrogen generation, transmission and storage, including both “green” hydrogen from electrolysis and “blue” hydrogen from natural gas reforming with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Concurrent optimization of all major system elements revealed that balancing VRE with electrolysis involves substantial additional costs beyond reduced electrolyzer capacity factors. Depending on the location of electrolyzers, greater capital expenditures are also required for hydrogen pipelines and storage infrastructure (to handle intermittent hydrogen production) or electricity transmission networks (to transmit VRE peaks to electrolyzers). Blue hydrogen scenarios face similar constraints. High VRE shares impose low utilization rates of CO2 capture, transport and storage infrastructure for conventional CCS, and of hydrogen transmission and storage infrastructure for a novel process (gas switching reforming) that enables flexible power and hydrogen production. In conclusion, all major system elements must be considered to accurately reflect the costs of using hydrogen to integrate higher VRE shares. © 2020 The Author(s)},

The use of hydrogen gas generated through off-peak electrolysis has been highlighted by the Canadian government as a potential avenue forward in managing electrical grids with surplus and intermittent electricity generation. This technology can be supported in a safe and cost-effective manner by underground hydrogen storage in geological formations.

A techno-economic and environmental analysis of methanol produced from captured CO2 and renewable energy is conducted to shed light on the transportation-power nexus. The investigated scenarios differ in how the carbon-free energy source – electricity from wind – is used to either decarbonise the electricity mix or produce green methanol to displace conventional fossil fuels. The assessment is carried out for six countries that differ in the composition of their electricity mix and gasoline consumption. The results of this holistic assessment show that, at present, decarbonising the electricity grid using renewable energy sources and carbon capture and storage would offer greater environmental benefits, without incurring large changes in direct economic costs, compared to producing methanol from the hydrogenation of captured CO2. Though this insight might change in the future if the carbon intensity of the mix is reduced and green methanol becomes cheaper, it highlights the need to consider the transportation-power nexus in assessing alternative fuels and thereby prevent shifting of emissions from one sector to another over their life cycle. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the uncertainties in their outputs make some difficulties in making operational decisions. Hydrogen energy plays a considerable role in this concept. Besides, energy hubs (EHs) provide an efficient and reliable framework for gathering multi-type energy carriers.This paper optimally schedules the operating of the EH and decreases the emission cost, considering the electrical and thermal demand response (DR) program in a probabilistic environment. Besides plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and a complete model of hydrogen-based renewable energy sources are presented in the EH. Taking into account uncertainties of electrical/thermal energy markets real-time prices, customers' energy demand, and energy production of RESs into account, various scenarios are generated using the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Next, an efficient method is used to reduce the number of the scenario to make the optimization problem computable and fast. In order to reduce the risk of encountering high operating costs, the conditional value at risk (CVaR) technique is used to manage the associated risk. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method in decreasing the operational cost and managing the risk of encountering unfavorable states. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

We use hourly data in four locations with world-class solar in the Atacama desert and wind in Patagonia steppes. We find that hybridization of wind and solar can reduce hydrogen production costs by a few percents, when the effect of increasing the load factor on the electrolyser overweighs the electricity cost increase. For ammonia production, the gains by hybridization can be substantially larger, because it reduces the power variability, which is costly, due to the need for intermediate storage of hydrogen between the flexible electrolyser and the less flexible ammonia synthesis unit. Our modelling reveals the crucial role in the synthesis of flexibility, which cuts the cost of variability, especially for the more variable wind power. Our estimated near-term production costs for green hydrogen, around 2 USD/kg, and green ammonia, below 500 USD/t, are encouragingly close to competitiveness against fossil-fuel alternatives. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Concentrated solar thermal technology is considered a very promising renewable energy technology due to its capability of producing heat and electricity and of its straightforward coupling to thermal storage devices. Conventionally, this approach is mostly used for power generation. When coupled with the right conversion process, it can be also used to produce methanol. Indeed methanol is a good alternative fuel for high compression ratio engines. Its high burning velocity and the large expansion occurring during combustion leads to higher efficiency compared to operation with conventional fuels. This study is focused on the system level modeling of methanol production using hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced with cerium oxide solar thermochemical cycle which is expected to be CO2 free. A techno-economic assessment of the overall process is done for the first time. The thermochemical redox cycle is operated in a solar receiver-reactor with concentrated solar heat to produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide as the main constituents of synthesis gas. Afterwards, the synthesis gas is turned into methanol whereas the methanol production process is CO2 free. The production pathway was modeled and simulations were carried out using process simulation software for MW-scale methanol production plant. The methanol production from synthesis gas utilizes plug-flow reactor. Optimum parameters of reactors are calculated. The solar methanol production plant is designed for the location Almeria, Spain. To assess the plant, economic analysis has been carried out. The results of the simulation show that it is possible to produce 27.81 million liter methanol with a 350 MWth solar tower plant. It is found out that to operate this plant at base case scenario, 880685 m2 of mirror's facets are needed with a solar tower height of 220 m. In this scenario a production cost of 1.14 €/l Methanol is predicted. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The integrated energy system (IES) can leverage the synergy of different types of energy systems, which contain considerable potential in the overall carbon emission mitigation. To achieve the low-carbon transition, financial incentives such as carbon trading are employed in the electricity and natural gas sectors to encourage flexibly emission mitigation to cover the extra carbon costs. However, the existing trading policy applies unilateral mechanism, carbon costs are usually levied on power generation and gas supply companies. Utility companies would simply pass-through the carbon costs to consumers by incorporating them into upward energy prices. Further, due to more than one form of energy consumption in integrated components, there are twofold charges of carbon costs for some consumers in IES. It would be difficult to mitigate carbon emission effectively and efficiently without an equitable trading mechanism. It should be noted that end-use consumers are the underlying drivers of emissions in the energy supply chain. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage low-carbon operation planning model based on a bilateral trading mechanism with active demand side management (DSM), aiming to mitigate carbon emissions. The carbon emission flow (CEF) model is applied to track the emissions and calculate the carbon intensities, energy storage systems like battery and power-to-gas (P2G) are considered. The proposed model is tested on a modified IEEE 24-bus electricity system and a modified 20-bus natural gas system. According to the simulation results, the proposed model is effective to reduce carbon intensity by increasing the proportion of energy with low carbon intensity in the energy mix and further achieve carbon emission mitigation. Meanwhile, the demand side can also obtain extra environmental financial benefits by DSM and planned zero-emission facilities under the bilateral trading mechanism. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {H2 is an important commodity chemical that can also be used as an alternative fuel. The way how H2 is currently produced and distributed, however, is not compatible with this usage. This is primarily due to the high costs associated with storing and delivering H2 from the centralized production facilities to the end-use sites like H2 stations that will be distributed throughout a region. Here, we propose a methodology for configuring the distributed H2 production system that minimizes the overall cost in delivering H2 to demand sites while meeting the safety requirements. The methodology also takes into account changes in costs with respect to production volume by applying the concept of economy of scale. The proposed methodology is applied to a hypothetical case involving H2 supply to three stations. The results demonstrate significant reduction in the overall cost when adopting the optimal solution found by our methodology compared to the traditional, centralized production system. Insights on the cost structures associated with producing and delivering H2 are provided, as well as specific improvements required to make H2 affordable at the level defined by the international society. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Low-carbon hydrogen is considered as one of the key measures to decarbonise continental Europe and Japan. Northern Norway has abundant renewable energy and natural gas resources which can be converted to low-carbon hydrogen. However, Norway is located relatively far away from these markets and finding efficient ways to transport this hydrogen to the end-user is critical. In this study, liquefied hydrogen (LH2) and ammonia (NH3), as H2-based energy carriers, are analysed and compared with respect to energy efficiency, CO2 footprint and cost. It is shown that the LH2 chain is more energy efficient and has a smaller CO2 footprint (20 and 23 kg-CO2/MWhth for Europe and Japan, respectively) than the NH3 chain (76 and 122 kg-CO2/MWhth). Furthermore, the study finds the levelized cost of hydrogen delivered to Rotterdam to be lower for LH2 (5.0 EUR/kg-H2) compared to NH3 (5.9 EUR/kg-H2), while the hydrogen costs of the two chains for transport to Japan are in a similar range (about 7 EUR/kg-H2). It is also shown that under optimistic assumptions, the costs associated with the LH2 chain (3.2 EUR/kg-H2) are close to meeting the 2030 hydrogen cost target of Japan (2.5 EUR/kg-H2). © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Alongside substituting fossil fuels with renewable energies and increasing energy efficiency, the utilization of electricity-based hydrogen or its derived synthetic fuels is a potential strategy to meet ambitious European climate protection targets. As synthetic hydrocarbons have the same chemical properties as their fossil substitutes, existing infrastructures and well-established application technologies can be retained while CO2 emissions in energy conversion, transport, industry, and residential and services can be reduced. However, the conversion processes, especially the generation of hydrogen necessary for all e-fuels, are associated with energy losses and costs. To evaluate the techno-economic hydrogen production potential and the impact of its utilization on the rest of the energy system, a supply curve of electricity-based hydrogen in a greenhouse gas emission-free European energy system in 2050 was developed. It was found that hydrogen quantities of the order of magnitude envisaged in the 1.5 °C scenarios by the European Commission's long-term strategic vision (1536–1953 TWhH2) induce marginal hydrogen production costs of over 110 €2020/MWhH2 and electrolyzer capacities of more than 615 GWel. Although the generation of these amounts of hydrogen using electrolysis provides some flexibility to the electricity system and can integrate small amounts of local surplus electricity, an additional 766 GWel of wind power and 865 GWel of solar power must be installed to cover the additional electricity demand for hydrogen production. It was furthermore found that the most important techno-economic properties of electrolyzers used in an energy system dominated by renewable energies are the ability to operate flexibly and the conversion efficiency of electricity into hydrogen. It is anticipated that the shown analysis is valuable for both policy-makers, who need to identify research, subsidy and infrastructure requirements for a future energy system, and corporate decision-makers, whose business models will be significantly affected by the future availability of electricity-based fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

They are supplied by oxygen and hydrogen to produce electricity. That is why it is inescapable to find a source of hydrogen in order to use fuel cell. Several techniques can be adopted to produce hydrogen depending on the availability and the cost of the sources. One of the most utilized techniques is electrolysers. They allow to obtain hydrogen from water by several technologies among them proton exchange membrane (PEM) which is considered in this work. On the other hand, electrolysers need electrical power to operate. A green-green energy system can be constructed by using a renewable energy source to supply fuel cell trough electrolysers. A comparison between two solar systems (Photovoltaic and Parabolic Trough) coupled to fuel cell is performed. A case study on the Lebanese city of Tripoli is carried out.

Also considering the dynamic behaviour of the following hydrogen processes: production, storage, and use. The simplified scheme of the proposed system configuration to be studied consists of the use of alternative and renewable sources of energy (solar-wind-biogas) to generate electrical energy in order to produce hydrogen from electrolysis of the water, which is stored in its gaseous state and subsequently redirected to a filling station to be used as vehicle fuel in buses. The results show that to feed one bus the hybrid system generates an average of 78,110 kWh/month with an installed capacity of 1101.905 kW, producing 1209.90 kgH2/month through the electrolysis process from water. The results also show a range of electricity generation costs between 1.130 and 0.123 US$/kWh and H2 production between 0.963 and 0.110 US$/kWh. Concluding that the application of renewable energies to produce hydrogen and electricity for the public transport sector is an attractive alternative in the future throughout the country, because the proposed system is technically, economically and ecologically viable. © 2020},

	abstract = {Although hydrogen is identified to be the first choice of the energy industry in the future society, the severe shortage of hydrogen infrastructure hinders the development of the hydrogen economy. Therefore, by simultaneously integrating the planning and operation issues of a hydrogen supply chain network (HSCN) and taking the hydrogen demand of hydrogen fuel vehicles into account, this paper proposes a general optimization design model for a HSCN based on the off-grid wind-hydrogen coupling system to realize the scientific layout of hydrogen infrastructure and stimulate the transition of hydrogen energy. The uncertainties on both sides of the source and load of a HSCN are well-considered. Therein, the uncertainty of wind power is handled with chance constrained programming, while the uncertainty of hydrogen demand is addressed by a density-based clustering approach. The analysis focuses on a HSCN of Fujian Province, China and case study is conducted. Results show that the estimated hydrogen demand in Fujian Province over the course of a year is 0.197 million tons. The hydrogen production is located in Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Xiamen and the daily hydrogen production in Fuzhou is 309.11 ton/day, accounting for 57.48% of the total hydrogen production in Fujian Province. Since the revenue of the energy storage batteries cannot offset its high investment cost, the abnegation of the energy storage batteries in the HSCN is obtained. Compared with the deterministic HSCN, the total cost of the HSCN considering the uncertainties of wind power and hydrogen demand is reduced by 1.35%. The Levelized cost of hydrogen is 3.073–3.155$/kg and hydrogen production shows a significant scale effect. These results could provide information and direction to stakeholders, investors and policymakers for the planning of the future HSCN in Fujian Province to promote the tremendous development of the hydrogen industry. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Thermocatalytic transformations of captured CO2 into CO, CH3OH, or CH4 via hydrogenation reactions are attractive because they are desired to mitigate the anthropogenic CO2 emission and reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, CO2 hydrogenation technologies inevitably require a source of H2 and significant energy input, both of which are predominately generated by CO2-emitting fossil fuels, currently. It is unclear whether the overall process is net CO2 negative and which technology pathway has the most potential to achieve net CO2 reduction with various energy sources. In this work, we summarize the energy and material balances of various proposed industrial-scale CO2 hydrogenation processes coupled with credible thermodynamic and kinetic models. The performance of the CO2 conversion to CO, CH3OH, and CH4 processes is evaluated in terms of overall energy consumption, net CO2 emission, and levelized cost of CO2 conversion under various conditions. Simulation results show that the overall energy consumption and net CO2 emission of all the five proposed CO2 hydrogenation processes are relying heavily on the sources of energy and hydrogen. The CO2-CH4 process would show the best CO2 reduction capacity when the energy consumption of H2 production is lower than 61.1 MJ⋅kgH2−1 with more renewable energy added. Thermocatalytic transformations of captured CO2 are at present economically unattractive and emit more CO2 than they convert as the required energy and hydrogen mainly come from fossil fuels. However, these processes can be driven to economically attractive when the cost of renewable energy is decreased (by an order of magnitude), and a potential CO2 tax (0.29 US$⋅kgCO2−1) is implemented, leading to a significant reduction of atmospheric CO2. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of different CO2 hydrogenation processes with thermodynamics and kinetic models based on various energy and hydrogen sources, providing a rational guideline for the industrial application of these hydrogenation processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The increasing use of renewable energy leads to a higher share of intermittent and volatile electricity generation. In this paper, we develop FLEXIES, a new open-source power system optimization model to determine the cost-efficient deployment of renewable electricity generation technologies and flexibility technologies. We apply FLEXIES in a case study of power systems in Central Europe (Switzerland, Austria, France, Germany, and Italy) in 2030, 2040, and 2050. The case study indicates that low-carbon electricity generation, batteries, and power-to-gas, consisting of multiple gas storages, are cost-efficient in 2050 – rather than burning natural gas in gas turbines. Such decarbonized power systems could be cost-efficient earlier assuming sufficiently high carbon prices. Furthermore, we find that onshore wind is prioritized over highly volatile solar generation due to a lower need for electricity storage. Interconnections enable higher shares of uniform generation technologies (on– and offshore wind, nuclear, biomass-waste) and reduce the need for solar and storage. Hence, compared to a case in which countries are isolated, interconnections reduce total electricity generation by up to 8.2%, system costs by up to 16.3%, and carbon equivalent emissions by up to 9.0%. Finally, we observe that decarbonized power systems entail a cost shift from the operational to the investment phase and total normalized costs could be higher than power market prices.

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the development of zero-emissions, sustainable energy systems utilising the potential of hydrogen energy technologies. However, the improper long-term economic assessment of costs and consequences of such hydrogen-based renewable energy systems has hindered the transition to the so-called hydrogen economy in many cases. One of the main reasons for this is the inefficiency of the optimization techniques employed to estimate the whole-life costs of such systems. Owing to the highly nonlinear and non-convex nature of the life-cycle cost optimization problems of sustainable energy systems using hydrogen as an energy carrier, meta-heuristic optimization techniques must be utilised to solve them. To this end, using a specifically developed artificial intelligence-based micro-grid capacity planning method, this paper examines the performances of twenty meta-heuristics in solving the optimal design problems of three conceptualised hydrogen-based micro-grids, as test-case systems. Accordingly, the obtained numeric simulation results using MATLAB indicate that some of the newly introduced meta-heuristics can play a key role in facilitating the successful, cost-effective development and implementation of hydrogen supply chain models. Notably, the moth-flame optimization algorithm is found capable of reducing the life-cycle costs of micro-grids by up to 6.5% as compared to the dragonfly algorithm. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The subsurface storage of hydrogen (H2) provides a potential solution for load-balancing of the intermittent electricity production from renewable energy sources. In such technical concept, surplus electricity is used to power electrolyzers that produce H2, which is then stored in subsurface formations to be used at times when renewable electricity is not available. Blending H2 with natural gas (NG) for injection into depleted gas/oil reservoirs, which are already used for NG storage, is considered a good option due to the lower initial capital cost and investment needed, and potential lower operating costs. In this study, the potential impact of storing a mixture of H2 and NG in an existing NG storage field was investigated. Relevant reservoir, caprock and cement samples from a NG storage formation in California were characterized with respect to their permeability, porosity, surface area, mineralogy and other structural characteristics, before and after undergoing 3-month incubation experiments with H2/NG gas mixtures at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. The results indicated relatively small changes in porosity and mineralogy due to incubation. However, the observed changes in permeability were more dramatic. In addition, polymeric materials, similar to those used in NG storage operations were also incubated, and their dimensions were measured before and after incubation. These measurements indicated swelling due to the exposure to H2. However, direct evidence of geochemical reactions involving H2 was not observed. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Hydrothermal carbonization and pyrolysis can convert wet organic wastes into hydrochar and pyrochar, which are potential fossil fuel alternatives due to their comparable fuel properties. Machine learning (ML) has strong prediction ability after being trained with historic dataset and facilitates good understanding of the impact of input features on output targets through a data-driven approach. In this study, ML models for multi-task prediction of fuel properties of the chars were developed and optimized based on two datasets for hydrochar and pyrochar. Feature importance and correlation were explored based on optimized ML model, and feature re-examination was conducted for model improvement. Results showed that support vector regression model with optimal hyper-parameters exhibited better generalized performance for prediction of both hydrochar and pyrochar properties with the best average R2 of 0.90 and 0.94. ML-based feature analysis indicated that process temperature and carbon content in the feedstock were the significant features impacting fuel properties of both chars, while nitrogen content was another important input feature for hydrochar and hydrogen content for pyrochar. The accuracy (especially for pyrochar), generalization ability, and computational speed of models were further improved after feature re-examination. The intuitions obtained from feature analysis provided meaningful insights to select input features for prediction performance improvement and computational cost saving, and might guide experiments to produce chars with desired quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The transition of the motorized private transport sector from fossil fuel to electricity-based technologies is a widely discussed strategy that can contribute towards the achievement of the set climate protection targets. To accurately analyse the challenges and opportunities associated with this transition, the entire energy system needs to be considered in a holistic way. This study introduces two different methodological approaches for the assessment of battery electric vehicles. Both are implemented into the sector coupling, structure optimising model REMod and assessed for a future, nearly CO2 neutral German energy system. The results show that realistic driving profiles could lead to simultaneous vehicle charging, which result in higher peak loads and eventually require an increase in power plant capacity. The model shows that once vehicles are charged irrespective of the residual load, electricity-demanding technologies throughout all sectors are progressively replaced by hydrogen or other gas-based technologies, as these options do not lead to an increase in electricity demand. This development negatively impacts the deployment of electric heat pumps and battery electric vehicles, which would play a major role otherwise. The cost-optimal system configuration can be achieved through implementation of a controlled charging strategy, shaving power load and supply peaks, integrating more power from variable renewable energy sources and reducing the yearly overall system costs by several billion Euros. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) shows promise as an energy carrier in contributing to emissions reductions from sectors which have been difficult to decarbonize, like industry and transportation. At the same time, flexible H2 production via electrolysis can also support cost-effective integration of high shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) in the power system. In this work, we develop a least-cost investment planning model to co-optimize investments in electricity and H2 infrastructure to serve electricity and H2 demands under various low-carbon scenarios. Applying the model to a case study of Texas in 2050, we find that H2 is produced in approximately equal amounts from electricity and natural gas under the least-cost expansion plan with a CO2 price of $30–60/tonne. An increasing CO2 price favors electrolysis, while increasing H2 demand favors H2 production from Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) of natural gas. H2 production is found to be a cost effective solution to reduce emissions in the electric power system as it provides flexibility otherwise provided by natural gas power plants and enables high shares of VRE with less battery storage. Additionally, the availability of flexible electricity demand via electrolysis makes carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment for SMR cost-effective at lower CO2 prices ($90/tonne CO2) than for power generation ($180/tonne CO2). The total emissions attributable to H2 production is found to be dependent on the H2 demand. The marginal emissions from H2 production increase with the H2 demand for CO2 prices less than $90/tonne CO2, due to shift in supply from electrolysis to SMR. For a CO2 price of $60/tonne we estimate the production weighted-average H2 price to be between $1.30–1.66/kg across three H2 demand scenarios. These findings indicate the importance of joint planning of electricity and H2 infrastructure for cost-effective energy system decarbonization. © 2020 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {With the increasing proportion of renewable energy (mainly wind power and photovoltaic) connected to the grid, the fluctuation of renewable energy power brings great challenges to the safe and reliable operation of power grid. As a clean, low-carbon secondary energy, hydrogen energy is applied in renewable energy (mainly wind power and photovoltaic) grid-connected power smoothing, which opens up a new way of coupling hydrogen storage energy with renewable energy. This paper focuses on the optimization of capacity of electrolyzers and fuel cells and the analysis of system economy in the process of power output smoothing of wind/photovoltaic coupled hydrogen energy grid-connected system. Based on the complementary characteristics of particle swarm optimization (PSO) and chemical reaction optimization algorithm (CROA), a particle swarm optimization-chemical reaction optimization algorithm (PSO-CROA) are proposed. Aiming at maximizing system profit, the capacity of electrolyzers and fuel cells are constrained by wind power fluctuation, and considering environmental benefits, government subsidies and time value of funds, the objective function and its constraints are established. According to the simulation analysis, by comparing the calculated results with PSO and CROA, it shows that PSO-CROA effectively evaluates the economy of the system, and optimizes the optimal capacity of the electrolyzers and fuel cells. The conclusion of this paper is of great significance for the application of hydrogen energy storage in the evaluation of power smoothness and economy of renewable energy grid connection and the calculation of economic allocation of hydrogen energy storage capacity. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The aim of this study was to investigate the prospects of implementing hydrogen technologies in the electricity network as an electricity production unit or/and utilise the produced hydrogen as transportation fuel. Three main scenarios were identified to be the most appropriate for this: (1) Support of the electrical grid via a fuel cell; (2) participation of a hydrogen production and fuel cell system in the electricity and transportation markets; and (3) participation in the transportation market. The results indicated that a fuel cell generator providing ancillary services is not economically viable in the investigated case study, while implementing a hydrogen production unit with a hydrogen fuel selling price between 4 and 114 €/kgH2, depending on the electrolyser's power input, will yield positive results. For the third scenario, the hydrogen fuel price ranged between 3.6 and 15.0 €/kgH2. This research shows that hydrogen technologies can be used in the electricity and transportation markets from a technical point of view. However, from an economic point of view, a hydrogen system used only for a single application does not seem to be financially appealing. This suggests that reducing the investment cost and/or limiting operating costs is mandatory to support this type of investment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of energy production in a pilot building located in Slovenia, which is a typical residential house with an installed photovoltaic (PV) system and pilot battery storage system. Energy management system gathers data from smart meters every 15 min. As the pilot building location is in central Europe, complete energy self-sufficiency cannot be provided. The most problematic period of energy production with photovoltaic systems is winter. Solar radiation during the winter is much lower than in the summer and sometimes snow covers photovoltaic panels and disables energy production. Energy production and energy consumption are analyzed for one year. This study shows that complete self-sufficiency can be achieved by supplementing photovoltaic systems with hydrogen fuel cells. The amount of hydrogen, which would suffice for complete self-sufficiency for the whole period, is calculated according to the analyzed data. A synergy between photovoltaic system and hydrogen fuel cells is a step forward to complete self-sufficiency with renewable energy sources. The share of self-sufficiency of a hybrid PV fuel cell system would be 62.13%, meaning that there is no possibility for complete self-sufficiency from the pilot system. The shortage of hydrogen is 144.24 kg for one year and for achieving complete energy self-sufficiency, PV system should be bigger. A hybrid system with photovoltaic system, battery storage system and hydrogen fuel cells can be a solution for complete self-sufficiency. From an economic point of view, such systems are accessible for commercial use. The initial investment is relatively high, because of the high cost of the hydrogen storage tank. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This study quantifies the environmental opportunity cost and determines the net CO2 emissions when CCU methanol offsets the production of conventional methanol across 14 scenarios. The 14 scenarios account for capturing CO2 from 3 sources (combined and conventional natural gas, and coal power plants) and generating H2 with electricity from 3 sources (photovoltaics, wind and the grid). The CO2 avoided by using RE on the grid is greater than that from producing CCU methanol by 660 to 11960 kg CO2/ton methanol across the 14 scenarios. Unless the grid CO2 intensity drops below 67 g CO2/kWh, it is environmentally preferable to supply RE to the grid than for use in CCU methanol production. At the thermodynamic limit of CCU methanol production, the grid CO2 intensity should be lower than 82 g CO2/kWh, which is unlikely in the US before 2050. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {To reduce the fossil-fuel consumption and the impacts of conventional ammonia production on climate change, green ammonia production processes using green hydrogen need to be investigated. For commercial production scale, potential alternatives can be based on biomass gasification and water electrolysis via renewable energy, namely biomass- and power-to-ammonia. The former generally uses entrained flow gasifier due to low CO2 and almost no tar, and air separation units are shared by the gasifier and ammonia synthesis. The latter may use solid-oxide electrolyzer due to high electrical efficiency and the possibility of heat integration with the ammonia synthesis process. In this paper, techno-economic feasibility of these two green ammonia production processes are investigated and compared with the state-of-the-art methane-to-ammonia process, considering system-level heat integration and optimal placement of steam cycles for heat recovery. With a reference ammonia production of 50 kton/year, the results show that there are trade-offs between the overall energy efficiency (LHV) and ammonia production cost for all three cases. The biomass-to-ammonia is the most exothermic but is largely limited by the large heat requirement of acid gas removal. The steam cycles with three pressure levels are able to maximize the heat utilization at the system level. The power-to-ammonia achieves the highest system efficiency of over 74%, much higher than that of biomass-to-ammonia (44%) and methane-to-ammonia (61%). The biomass-to-ammonia reaches above 450 $/ton ammonia production cost with a payback time of over 6 years, higher than those of methane-to-ammonia (400 $/ton, 5 years). The power-to-ammonia is currently not economically feasible due to high stack costs and electricity prices; however, it can be competitive with a payback time of below 5 years with mass production of solid-oxide industry and increased renewable power penetration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This work is novel in that it assesses the challenges and economic incentives available to make feasible the installation of a hydrogen-based energy storage systems within the Province of Ontario from a techno-economic, policy and environmental perspectives. The energy hub analyzed in this work uses electricity from the power grid and solar PVs to meet the manufacturer's demands, while converting the excess to hydrogen gas, which is used across an array of pathways to generate revenue. ThisThis includes a blend ofof hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), hydrogen for forklifts, and the direct injection of hydrogen into the facility's natural gas, adding renewable content to the heating, and manufacturing processes. Our primary objective was to implement a safe design that minimizes capital and operating costs, resulting in a favorable business case for producing hydrogen, and providing ancillary grid services. However, Power-to-Gas creates a net-emission reduction that can be used not only to sell emission allowances in the provincial carboncarbon tax program for up to $30/t-CO2eq but to assist the Company in achieving their strategic emission reduction targets. Installation of the selected Power-to-Gas system would require a total capital investment of $2,620,448 with the electrolyzers and solar panels accounting for 41% and 17% of the capital costs, respectively. The compressors will account for most of the operating costs which total $237,653 annually. Within the energy hub, 76,073 kg-H2 has been produced per year for end-use applications. A sensitivity analysis was performed by varying both hydrogen and carbon credit price which predicted a potentialpotential CO2 offset of 2359.7 tonne/yr with a payback period of as little as 2.8 years. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Each system studies the effective combination of supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries and proton exchange membrane fuel cells (SC/LIB/PEMFC) on board. The first system uses renewable sources (PV/HKT/GB/Grid) supplying the on-board systems through the existing grid and hydrogen charging stations. While the second system uses only grid power from a single point of charge, leaving the tramway without any external connection point throughout their journey. The energy and economic analyses are based on the capacity of each system to supply the load and the resources used. The results show that the new proposed control systems, by means of the analysed configurations made up of different control states, are always capable of perfectly supplying the power required by the tramway throughout their journey. However, when using energy from renewable sources, hydrogen consumption decreases by 4.27% with respect to the grid on each round trip, with a lower net present cost. Furthermore, in the first proposed system, the depth of discharge in SC and LIB is greater. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In addition, the penalty cost of wind curtailment and hydrogen supply shortage and the system environmental benefits are taken into account. Results show: during the long-term of insufficient of wind power, it is better to produce hydrogen using wind power and grid-assisted power to avoid hydrogen supply shortage; considering the future increase of hydrogen demand, the optimal supply number of hydrogen refueling stations in the wind-hydrogen system is two. Also, the low utilization of fuel cells means that the benefit from regeneration cannot offset the high cost, which leads to the abnegation of fuel cells in the wind-hydrogen system. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Photocatalysis and electrolysis are crucial processes for the development of a sustainable, clean energy system, since they enable solar fuel production, such as hydrogen by water splitting, as well as CO2 reduction. In these processes efficient and robust catalysts for water oxidation are required and the reduction of employed amount of noble metals is crucial to reduce costs and increase the sustainability of the technology. To obtain extremely low iridium loading on nickel foam electrodes we have employed electroless deposition by spontaneous galvanic displacement as a simple, low cost, highly scalable technique. After deposition the Ir oxidation has been achieved by annealing in air at 250 °C. By varying the deposition parameters, an optimal condition has been achieved, with an overpotential for water oxidation of 360 mV at 10 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH solution. The Ni foam coverage with Ir oxide has also a positive impact on the electrode stability, strongly decreasing the degradation rate, compared to the case of bare Ni foam. The average amount of noble metal in the best performing electrode is only 35 μg cm−2 for a 1.6 mm thick Ni foam electrode. The proposed approach is highly promising for gas diffusion electrodes, and can be implemented in electrolytic cells, as well as in fuel cells. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {A large-scale hydrogen supply chain is an alternative for the transportation of energy generated from a renewable energy source. Utilizing this technology would drastically improve the generation of clean energy. Therefore, an analysis method to estimate the economic and environmental benefits of the introduction of a hydrogen supply chain using an existing pipeline is developed. The proposed method first estimates the energy and exergy flows in the system to calculate the overall efficiency of these quantities. Afterward, the payback period is estimated based on the overall energy efficiency using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The overall efficiency of the system, based on the energy analysis presented, would seem to be the final delivered electrical, fuel and useable heat energy delivered to end use divided by the input solar and wind energy. Furthermore, the environmental effects due to the introduction of the systems are evaluated considering the reduction of global warming and air pollution gases, such as CO2 and PM2.5. The proposed analysis method was applied considering a natural gas pipeline that connects Qinghai and Shanghai. As a result, conversion ratios of 24.9% for electricity and 17.5% for heat were achieved, with the overall efficiency of the system of 42.4% based on the electricity obtained from photovoltaics. 3.02 Gt of CO2, 104 kt of SOx, and 134 kt of NOx, which represent 3.3%, 0.5%, and 0.6% of the annual discharge in China, respectively, and 8.66 kt of PM2.5 would be reduced every year. Furthermore, a reduction of 953 Mt in coal consumption is expected. The payback period of the proposed system using the DCF method is 4.17 and 2.28 years for the two alternatives evaluated in this work.

	abstract = {Utilizing renewable energy resources is one of the convenient ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the intermittent nature of these resources has led to stochastic characteristics in the generation and load balancing of the microgrid systems. To handle these issues, an energy management optimization for microgrids operation should be done to urge the minimization of total system costs, emissions, and fuel consumption. An optimization program for decreasing the operational cost of a hybrid microgrid consisting of photovoltaic array, wind unit, electrolyzer, hydrogen storage system, reformer, and fuel cell is presented. Two different methods of producing hydrogen are considered in this study to ensure the effectiveness of the developed methodology. In the microgrid system with high penetration of renewable energy resources, using storage technologies to compensate for the intermittency of these resources is necessary. To evaluate the functioning of the microgrid system, a mathematical model for each source is developed to coordinate the system operation involving energy conversion between hydrogen and electricity. Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm is utilized to determine the optimum size and operational energy management within the system. It is evident from the results that there is about a 10% reduction in the amount of CH4 consumption in reformer when the electrolyzer was employed in the system. It is observed that the CH4 reduction in summer and fall is higher than other seasons (10.6% and 11.5%, respectively). The reason is that the highest RES production occurs in these seasons during a year. It is also worth mentioning that the electrolyzer technology would play a significant role in decreasing the CH4 consumption in the microgrid system. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The role of hydrogen in a future energy system with a high share of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) is regarded as crucial in order to balance fluctuations in electricity generation. These fluctuations can be compensated for by flexibility measures such as the expansion of transmission, flexible generation, larger back-up capacity and storage. Salt cavern storage is the most promising technology due to its large storage capacity, followed by pumped hydro storage. For the underground storage of chemical energy carriers such as hydrogen, salt caverns offer the most promising option owing to their low investment cost, high sealing potential and low cushion gas requirement. This paper provides a suitability assessment of European subsurface salt structures in terms of size, land eligibility and storage capacity. Two distinct cavern volumes of 500,000 m3 and 750,000 m3 are considered, with preference being given for salt caverns over bedded salt deposits and salt domes. The storage capacities of individual caverns are estimated on the basis of thermodynamic considerations based on site-specific data. The results are analyzed using three different scenarios: onshore and offshore salt caverns, only onshore salt caverns and only onshore caverns within 50 km of the shore. The overall technical storage potential across Europe is estimated at 84.8 PWhH2, 27% of which constitutes only onshore locations. Furthermore, this capacity decreases to 7.3 PWhH2 with a limitation of 50 km distance from shore. In all cases, Germany has the highest technical storage potential, with a value of 9.4 PWhH2, located onshore only in salt domes in the north of the country. Moreover, Norway has 7.5 PWhH2 of storage potential for offshore caverns, which are all located in the subsurface of the North Sea Basin. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The electrochemical production of hydrogen is a promising and flexible approach towards the conversion of intermittent renewable energy sources into clean chemical fuel. However, low-cost, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts are yet to be developed to attain economies of scale in hydrogen generation. In this study, we fabricated highly ordered free-standing TiO2 nanotube arrays (TiO2-NTs), by simply anodizing Ti foils. The tube length, diameter, wall thickness, and surface structure of the TiO2-NTs can be controlled by adjusting the anodization conditions. Subsequently, we synthesized and supported MoS2 layers on free-standing TiO2-NTs as an active material for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), using a slow evaporation method. The layers of MoS2 uniformly disperse on the entire surface of the TiO2-NTs composite. The electrochemical test shows that the MoS2-supported free-standing (MoS2/TiO2-NTs) system exhibits excellent HER performance in acidic media with a low overpotential at 10 mA cm−2 (170 mV), as well as small Tafel slope (70 mV decade−1). Also, the MoS2/TiO2-NTs displays superior durability for HER after 5000 continuous potential cycles between −0.4 and + 0.2 (V vs. RHE). Our results demonstrate the potential application of MoS2/TiO2-NTs composite for cost-effective electrochemical production of hydrogen. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Injection of hydrogen into existing natural gas grids, either partially or as a complete conversion, could decarbonise heat and take advantage of the inherent flexibility that gas grids provide in a low-carbon future. However, hydrogen injection is not straightforward due to the differing properties of the gases and the need for low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen supply chains. In this study, an up-to-date assessment of the opportunities and challenges for hydrogen injection is provided. Through value chain optimisation, the outlook for hydrogen injection is considered in the context of a national energy system with a high reliance on natural gas. The optimisation captures the operational details of hydrogen injection and gas grid flexibility, whilst also modelling the wider context, including interactions with the electricity system and delivery of energy from primary resource to end-use. It is found that energy systems are ready for partial hydrogen injection now and that relatively low feed-in tariffs (£20–50/MWh) could incentivise it. Partial hydrogen injection could provide a stepping stone for developing a hydrogen infrastructure but large scale decarbonisation of gas grids requires complete conversion to hydrogen. Whether this solution is preferable to electrification in the long term will depend on the value of the gas grid linepack flexibility and the costs of expanding electricity infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introducing natural gas/hydrogen mixtures to an installed population of domestic natural gas appliances necessarily implies considering the risk of flashback. Previously, we quantified this risk via an interchangeability analysis using calculated laminar burning velocities. With an increasing contribution of renewable energy, still higher hydrogen fractions will become of interest to improve the economic viability in power-to-gas chains. To extend the possibilities for hydrogen admixture beyond the limits given by extant ranges of Wobbe Index and burning velocity, appliance approval standards and gas regulations must be examined to assess the degree to which higher hydrogen fractions are, or can be, justified. However, the current standards and regulations do not consider the risk of flashback in terms of the laminar burning velocity explicitly, leaving the justification of higher hydrogen fractions to empirical observations followed when the approval standards were codified. Here, we reframe the approval and regulation standards in terms of the calculated laminar burning velocity, which quantifies the notion of a ‘safety margin’ to safeguard appliance performance with respect to flashback, for a group of natural gases that is commonplace in the European Union (EU) but representative for many international situations. The method presented can be applied for any local regulatory area. In plots of burning velocity vs. equivalence ratio, ranges of regulated gas qualities are represented as a curve for natural gases, while for natural gas/hydrogen mixtures they appear as areas indicating the variations in hydrogen fraction for different gas compositions that do not increase the risk of flashback. To quantify the safety margin, the approval gas used in the EU for flashback (G222) is taken as an example, because of the many decades of experience in using this gas to safeguard appliance performance. Using the assumed range of gas quality and approval gas as an example, for appliances whose primary equivalence ratio is fuel rich (at greatest risk for flashback), a safety margin of 11.5 cm/s is determined and used in analyses for determining the composition of flashback limit gases in approval standards for a situation in which higher hydrogen fractions are desired. Situations considering both variable and constant fractions of hydrogen in natural gas are examined. The end-use demand for a minimum degree of thermal comfort, by having a minimum Wobbe Index in the regulated range of gas quality, automatically complicates grid management schemes for hydrogen addition: the maximum hydrogen admixture is necessarily coupled to the composition of the natural gas to which it is added. The only solution for having a constant hydrogen fraction without regard to the gas composition is by relaxing this demand on thermal comfort; in the example used here, 20% hydrogen admixture reduces the thermal comfort in the worst case by 4.7%. Fuel suppliers, grid operators and end users must agree to this loss of fitness for purpose to maximize the decarbonization of the gas supply by hydrogen admixture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {21st century energy production, conversion, and delivery systems need to go through a transition to be less carbon-intensive while meeting an increasing energy demand. In a more and more interconnected world, energy systems of various sectors (e.g. power, fuels, chemicals, etc.) go through this transition via shifting the primary energy sources from carbon-intensive fossil-fuels to renewable and sustainable resources. With this study, we present a multi-scale strategy for optimal design and operation of multi-product process systems that can produce power, synthetic fuels, chemicals, and energy carriers from renewable and fossil resources. This multi-scale approach combines process synthesis, scheduling, and supply chain concepts in a mixed-integer linear programming model to address the trade-offs between integrating various fossil and renewable technologies. Our strategy is applied to integration of low-emission (i) synthetic liquid transportation fuels, (ii) hydrogen, (iii) ammonia, (iv) methanol, and (v) renewable power production from natural gas, solar, and wind energy at a location in Amarillo, Texas. Case study results show that with our approach various energy systems can be modeled either separately and integrated with the same common representation. Sectors integration to produce low-emission products in the same facility can result in 17% reduction in total production costs. While solar and wind energy are favorable to produce renewable power, current state-of-the-art methane conversion technologies are more favorable to produce hydrogen and hydrogen-based products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A novel stand-alone charging station (CS) powered by a combination of solar and wind energy in presence of a fuel cell (FC) system is designed and constructed for charging plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The built CS is high-efficient due to putting to practical use a proposed novel variable step-size maximum power point tracking (MPPT) scheme applied to both photovoltaic (PV) and wind parts of the CS. The main defect of a stand-alone CS is its necessity to battery banks which not only are expensive but also provide short lifetime due to a considerable number of daily charge and discharge imposed to them in a CS. This problem has been solved in this study by utilizing a FC system as supporting power source playing two roles. First, whenever PV and wind power production is less than charge demand, the FC system produces extra electric energy required. Second, whenever PV and wind power production is more than charge demand, the electrolyzer of the FC system produces hydrogen by absorbing extra electric power available in the system. Thus, the FC system acts as a high-capacity storage device in continuously regulating charging power to instant charge demand. The CS has been built, and experimental measurements obtained from its realistic operation are presented that prove the novelty and contributions of the constructed CS compared to those available as: ● For the first time, it uses a FC system with permanent lifetime and a total cost of about $21000 as the storage device of the CS instead of an associated 6.5 kWh Li-ion battery bank providing a short lifetime of about 500 days and a total cost of about $70000 per 30 years. ● It is high-efficient due to using a proposed novel variable step-size MPPT scheme with the efficiency and tracking time of, respectively, 99.6% and 12 ms applied to both PV and wind parts of the CS that high efficiently converts solar and wind energy into electric power. ● It is stand-alone, completely autonomous and 100% renewable energy based resulting in unavailability of any harmful environmental impact and the possibility of installing the CS in remote areas where there is no grid. ● The total construction cost of the built CS is about $99500 with a payback period of only 16 months. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

RES have been evaluated using Fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), and environmental data envelopment analysis (DEA). Fuzzy Delphi finalizes criteria and sub-criteria. FAHP obtains relative weights of criteria considered for choosing the optimal RES. Environmental DEA measures relative efficiency of each RES using criteria weights as outputs, and RES-based electricity generation cost as input.

The integrated optimization network in this contribution addresses the following aspects: (1) biogas supply-demand distribution network, (2) hydrogen production technology allocation involving steam methane reforming and electrolysis, (3) carbon dioxide allocation, and (4) utilization of external resources. The proposed framework is mathematically expressed as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to minimize total annual cost which will be solved by graphical optimization approach, P-graph. A case study of the existing petrochemical industry complex in South Korea has been applied to the developed model. Feasible configuration for meeting base hydrogen demand (7200 tons H2/year) has been proposed with total annual cost of 75,772,460 US $/year. Apart from base hydrogen demand, the developed model is verified with the increase of hydrogen demand for 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%.

	abstract = {The emerging paradigm of interconnected microgrids advocates energy trading or sharing among multiple microgrids. It helps make full use of the temporal availability of energy and diversity in operational costs when meeting various energy loads. However, energy trading might not completely absorb excess renewable energy. A multi-energy management framework including fuel cell vehicles, energy storage, combined heat and power system, and renewable energy is proposed, and the characteristics and scheduling arrangements of fuel cell vehicles are considered to further improve the local absorption of the renewable energy and enhance the economic benefits of microgrids. While intensive research has been conducted on energy scheduling and trading problem, a fundamental question still remains unanswered on microgrid economics. Namely, due to multi-energy coupling, stochastic renewable energy generation and demands, when and how a microgrid should schedule and trade energy with others, which maximizes its long-term benefit. This paper designs a joint energy scheduling and trading algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization and a double-auction mechanism. Its purpose is to determine the valuations of energy in the auction, optimally schedule energy distribution, and strategically purchase and sell energy with the current electricity prices. Simulations based on real data show that each individual microgrid, under the management of the proposed algorithm, can achieve a time-averaged profit that is arbitrarily close to an optimum value, while avoiding compromising its own comfort. © 2020},

	abstract = {Due to the devastating ecological effects and constrained reserves of fossil fuels, renewable energies are now globally accepted as viable alternative sources of energy. Among renewable energy sources, wind energy has become globally popular, primarily because wind farms can be rapidly built and easily maintained at a relatively low cost. Wind-powered hydrogen production is an effective solution for storing the excess energy output of wind farms. The hydrogen produced in this way can be used not only in fuel cells but also in cooling, oil, gas, and petrochemical fields. As a country devastated by war and instability, Afghanistan has major energy generation challenges and a substantially large power supply deficiency. However, there are good wind energy potentials in several parts of this country. There are also several hydrogen-consuming fields in Afghanistan that can benefit from hydrogen production from wind energy. This paper endeavored to distinguish the appropriate areas in Afghanistan for harvesting wind energy for hydrogen production using multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Eleven criteria were utilized to prioritize 20 Afghan provinces with wind energy potential. The Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) was utilized to weight the criteria and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) were utilized to prioritize the provinces. Then, ARAS, TOPSIS, and VIKOR methods were used to validate the resultants. For criteria weighting with SWARA, “wind speed”, “wind power density” and “area of windy regions” with weights of 0.1423, 0.1356, and 0.1221 were introduced as the most significant criteria for this ranking. In all the rankings, Herat, Farah, and Jowzjan were identified as the top three most suitable provinces for wind power generation. The power output and hydrogen output to be achieved in Herat province using a 900-kW turbine were estimated to 2558.4 MW per year and 41.4 tons per year, respectively. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is regarded as secondary energy that is perfectly complementary to electricity owing to its friendly storage characteristics and can play a vital role in the future low-carbon society. Toward that end, we propose a regional electricity-hydrogen integrated energy system that can achieve high penetration of renewable energy using electricity and hydrogen as energy carriers. A bi-level mixed-integer planning model is proposed to highlight the role of hydrogen in renewable energy penetration and seasonal complementarity. The upper-level model aims at improving the system economy and optimizes the equipment configuration to meet the regional energy demands; the lower-level model minimizes the levelized cost of hydrogen to promote the development of hydrogen. Both the two levels cover binary variables to characterize the interactive states and ON/OFF states, which makes the bi-level model cannot be directly translated into an equivalent mathematical program with equilibrium constraints problem. Then, a reformulation and decomposition algorithm is applied to handle this complex problem with limited iterations. Case studies show that the proposed model can achieve the dual goals of optimizing the equipment configuration and reducing the supply price of hydrogen by rationally using resources such as wind, solar, and geothermal energy in the planning stage. © 2020},

	abstract = {One of the key challenges that still facing the adoption of renewable energy systems is having a powerful energy storage system (ESS) that can store energy at peak production periods and return it back when the demand exceeds the supply. In this paper, we discuss the costs associated with storing excess energy from power grids in the form of hydrogen using proton exchange membrane (PEM) reversible fuel cells (RFC). The PEM-RFC system is designed to have dual functions: (1) to use electricity from the wholesale electricity market when the wholesale price reaches low competitive values, use it to produce hydrogen and then convert it back to electricity when the prices are competitive, and (2) to produce hydrogen at low costs to be used in other applications such as a fuel for fuel cell electric vehicles. The main goal of the model is to minimize the levelized cost of energy storage (LCOS), thus the LCOS is used as the key measure for evaluating this economic point. LCOS in many regions in United States can reach competitive costs, for example lowest LCOS can reach 16.4¢/kWh in Illinois (MISO trading hub) when the threshold wholesale electricity price is set at $25/MWh, and 19.9¢/kWh in Texas (ERCOT trading hub) at threshold price of $20/MWh. Similarly, the levelized cost of hydrogen production shows that hydrogen can be produced at very competitive costs, for example the levelized cost of hydrogen production can reach $2.54/kg-H2 when using electricity from MISO hub. This value is close to the target set by the U.S. Department of Energy. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Concerns related to global warming and the depletion of fossil fuels have propelled the global community to explore alternative renewable energy sources. Biomass is a nonconventional and renewable energy resource that can potentially be utilised for the production of sustainable heat and power. The thermal gasification process is an effective biomass conversion and utilisation method producing syngas as the product gas. This study details a biomass gasification process and subsequent optimisation, considering multiple parameters, including the type of feedstock and gasifying agent (gasifier) to maximise hydrogen production. Aspen Plus software is used to develop three agent-based biomass gasification models considering the characteristics of certain materials from Qatar built environment. The ultimate goal of the study is to optimise the gasification processes to yield different biomass blending options satisfying the maximisation of hydrogen generation through different scenarios. The capabilities of the built-in activated analysis package using Aspen Energy Analyser and Aspen Process Economic Analyser are utilised to evaluate the environmental and economic perspectives. The results demonstrate the excellence of steam-only biomass gasification in providing profitable and cleaner products. The yield of hydrogen production from blending of biomass feedstock achieved a high fraction of 5.23% with the steam-only gasification, while the yield increased from 1.63% to 5.22% for the oxygen/steam gasification when maximising the hydrogen fraction. Moreover, the selective limiting of biomass capacity enhances the quality of syngas through enriching the hydrogen production and lowers the need for subsequent adjustment and the manipulation of gasifying agent quantity and operating energy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This study proposes a hybrid hydrogen supply system for the transport sector, which includes all the life stages from production, transport, and storage to final distribution (fueling stations). Particularly, we consider two types of resources for hydrogen production (i.e., renewable wind power and conventional natural gas) to identify the benefits and bottlenecks of hydrogen supply systems from the economic, environmental, and social perspectives. To achieve this goal, rigorous process models for the involved processes (i.e., hydrogen production by steam methane reforming from natural gas and water electrolysis using wind power, and hydrogen storage and transport) are developed. To illustrate the capability of the proposed system, we conducted a design problem within the hydrogen supply system in Jeju Island, Korea. In this case study, three scenarios were generated by combining different hydrogen production options: 1) wind power-based hydrogen production, 2) natural gas-based hydrogen production, and 3) integrated hydrogen production. As a result, we discussed the optimal hydrogen supply system, from the life cycle perspective, by identifying technical bottlenecks, major cost-drivers, and CO2 burdens. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) is being considered as an alternate renewable energy carrier due to the energy crisis, climate change and global warming. In the chemical industry, hydrogen production is mainly accomplished by the steam reforming of natural gas. In the present study, CuFeO2–CeO2 nanopowder catalyst with a heterogeneous delafossite structure was prepared by the self-combustion glycine nitrate process and used for steam reforming of methanol (SRM). The precursor solution was fabricated from Cu–Fe–Ce metal-nitrate mixed with glycine and an aqueous solution. The prepared CuFeO2–CeO2 nanopowder catalyst was studied by different physical and chemical characterization techniques. The prepared CuFeO2–CeO2 nanopowder catalyst was immensely porous with a coral-like structure. The BET surface area measurement revealed that the specific surface area of as-combusted CuFeO2–CeO2 nanopowder varied from 5.6248 m2/g to 19.5441 m2/g. In addition, the production rate of CuFeO2–CeO2 was improved by adding CeO2 and adjusting the feeding rate of the methanol. The highest H2 generation rate of the CuFeO2–CeO2 catalyst was 2582.25 (mL STP min−1 g-cat−1) at a flow rate of 30 sccm at 400 °C. Hence, the high specific surface area of the 70CuFeO2–30CeO2 nanopowder catalyst and the steam reforming process could have a very important industrial and economic impact. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Herein, the H2 generation over Ag-doped TiO2 photocatalyst, synthesized using a simple and cost-effective method based on chemical reduction, was reported.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the presence of oxygen vacancies and 11% of Ag in Ti–Ag–O phase.

The H2 production rate of 23.5 mmol g−1 h−1 (with an apparent quantum yield of 19%), over 1.5Ag/TiO2, was the highest ever reported so far. The observed higher activity could mainly be attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancies and the Ti–Ag–O phase. The photocatalyst was stable for three consecutive cycles in both the presence and absence of sacrificial reagents. This study offers new insights into the rational design of metal-support hybrid structures for hydrogen production through photocatalytic water splitting. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The use of economic and/or social criteria to locate the collecting technologies and the power production plants can strengthen the economy and mitigate the effect of the substitution of fossil based power plants. Economy growth, employment and population equity indexes and a mathematical formulation are developed to evaluate the optimal social location of renewable energy collection devices and power plants. These facilities are based on the storage of wind and solar energy in the form of metal hydride that produces power in a fuel cell using the hydrogen generated in its decomposition. The case study of Spain is considered to evaluate the substitution of base electricity since coal and nuclear facilities are closing down in June 2020 and 2030 respectively. Aiming at economic growth, a more distributed location of wind farms and PV panels is selected at a cost. If job generation is the target, only PV panels are selected and the preferred location is the Southern part of the country. However, a trade-off for the lay out can be achieved considering a multiobjective solution involving costs and social background. Substituting coal and nuclear power plants can generate over 500k jobs and help develop the regions reducing the impact of depopulation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Meanwhile, the catalyst shows remarkable OER activity with a low overpotential of 347 mV at 10 mA cm−2.

	abstract = {A technico-economic analysis based on integrated modeling, simulation, and optimization approach is used in this study to design an off grid hybrid solar PV/Fuel Cell power system. The main objective is to optimize the design and develop dispatch control strategies of the standalone hybrid renewable power system to meet the desired electric load of a residential community located in a desert region. The effects of temperature and dust accumulation on the solar PV panels on the design and performance of the hybrid power system in a desert region is investigated. The goal of the proposed off-grid hybrid renewable energy system is to increase the penetration of renewable energy in the energy mix, reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, and lower the cost of energy from the power systems. Simulation, modeling, optimization and dispatch control strategies were used in this study to determine the performance and the cost of the proposed hybrid renewable power system. The simulation results show that the distributed power generation using solar PV and Fuel Cell energy systems integrated with an electrolyzer for hydrogen production and using cycle charging dispatch control strategy (the fuel cell will operate to meet the AC primary load and the surplus of electrical power is used to run the electrolyzer) offers the best performance. The hybrid power system was designed to meet the energy demand of 4500 kWh/day of the residential community (150 houses). The total power production from the distributed hybrid energy system was 52% from the solar PV, and 48% from the fuel cell. From the total electricity generated from the photovoltaic hydrogen fuel cell hybrid system, 80.70% is used to meet all the AC load of the residential community with negligible unmet AC primary load (0.08%), 14.08% is the input DC power for the electrolyzer for hydrogen production, 3.30% are the losses in the DC/AC inverter, and 1.84% is the excess power (dumped energy). The proposed off-grid hybrid renewable power system has 40.2% renewable fraction, is economically viable with a levelized cost of energy of 145 $/MWh and is environmentally friendly (zero carbon dioxide emissions during the electricity generation from the solar PV and Fuel Cell hybrid power system). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This study involves the construction of a hydrogen supply chain optimization model using a centralized storage model that combines and consolidates flows of hydrogen from different production sites into integrated bulk storage. To supply hydrogen to a fuel cell electric vehicle station, various hydrogen supply pathways and storage configurations for different types of production technologies and transportation modes are considered. In terms of the topological structure, the centralized storage model requires fewer storage areas than the decentralized storage model. The results show that a hydrogen supply chain with a centralized storage structure advances the phase transition of central hydrogen production plants and reduces the total annual cost of the entire supply chain. The optimal hydrogen pathway is on-site steam methane reforming production in the early markets for fuel-cell electric vehicles. However, in matured markets, hydrogen is liquefied in central production plants and stored in bulk storages equipped with vaporizers. Then, the hydrogen is distributed from the central storage areas to local refueling stations via pipelines. The role of central storage areas is predicted to become important as market shares of fuel cell electric vehicle reach 15–30%; in other words, 0.28–0.56 million tonne/year of hydrogen will be demanded in 20 cities of South Korea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Bearing this potential failure in mind, the present study investigates technological options and their effectiveness for decarbonising the energy system from a systemic perspective. We consider the country's coal phase-out, the increasing amounts of electricity from renewable energy sources, more efficient heating concepts as well as the evolving of smart charging infrastructures and large-scale storage options. Based on the declared plans of the federal authorities and alternative proposals of environmental associations, ten distinct decarbonisation scenarios for the period from 2020 to 2030 form the basis of our models. Using the Energy PLAN simulation tool, annual and hourly performance indicators were computed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of decarbonisation measures. In particular, we examine the increasing usage of electrolysers for both the absorption of excess electricity and the production of hydrogen as a substitute for fossil fuels in relation to the timing of the coal phase-out. Pursuing this approach, we demonstrate the coherence between coal phase-out policies and low carbon technology diffusion. Our findings reveal that implementing the coal phase-out earlier than has been scheduled by the country's Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment mitigates the non-achievement of the decarbonisation targets. Moreover, our results suggest the upscaling of domestic electrolyser capacity to up to 9554 MW by 2030. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen fuel cells being hydrogen energy storage devices are the most effective and environmentally friendly for energy accumulation and storage. Direct current provides the accumulation of electric energy and is therefore necessary when using renewable energy sources. The social and environmental aspects, as well as climatic and glaciological features of the Arctic development in terms of energy supply are considered. The most expedient ways of complex development of the Arctic are shown. In terms of large and unique stationary projects a number of shortcomings is marked. They are high cost and long-term construction, incomplete autonomy and insufficient solution of ecological and waste processing problems. Incomplete autonomy is due to the need for transportation of materials, products, replacement crews and personnel, as well as insufficient logistics and transportation difficulties on the mainland in summer and by sea in winter. Ecological and waste processing problems are associated with the use of traditional methods of burning solid and liquid fuel using coal or fuel oil, polluting the environment. Switching to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) for electric propulsion and power supply will significantly improve the environmental situation. The research performed on the mathematical model of the multifunctional energy complex (MEC) showed the possibility of uninterrupted power supply of local load from the centralized network, diesel generator (DG) and the electricity storage (ES); by that DG is used to save fuel as a backup source. The proposed technologies of power generation based on hydrogen or low-power nuclear power plants (LPNPPs) allow, along with improving the environment, to increase the energy efficiency of the direct fuel conversion plant and provide integrated waste processing. The small population of the Arctic, its mobility when using the rotational method require the integrated development of mobile energy and life support systems of low power up to 30 MW using LNG or LPNPPs, completed by renewable energy sources (RES). If the hydrogen installation is both a source and a storage of electricity, the use of LPNPPs and especially RES require energy storage devices. These hydrogen or electrochemical cycle storage devices are the most progressive in the world energy sector and their applicability significantly depends on the development of the service infrastructure. Typing and replication of power supply sources will solve the problem of development of remote and isolated regions of the Arctic through the integrated use of innovative technologies for generation, storage, transmission and distribution of electricity, life support, utilization and recycling of wastes, environmental conservation using hydrogen energy and digital control and monitoring systems. The climatic conditions of the Arctic and the presence of LNG determine the use of hydrogen as a source for generating electricity, heat, water and air. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In recent years, several studies have been published focusing on the economics of the power sector under the high penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) following the rapid expansion of VRE capacities worldwide. However, detailed analyses of the fluctuations in meteorological conditions have hitherto been scarce, despite the expectation that VRE output will be significantly affected by them. To fill this gap, we investigated the economic likelihood of achieving a zero-emission power system in Japan by 2050, using multi-annual meteorological data from 1990 to 2017. We used a detailed linear programming optimization model, as well as a method that uses cumulative residual loads (CRL), which proved to be useful for estimating required energy storage capacities and for understanding the complex substitution of power generation and storage technologies. The estimated unit cost for a 100% renewable electricity system depends heavily on meteorological conditions, standing at 20.9 JPY/kWh with a standard deviation of 1.2 JPY/kWh, which declines to 18.3 JPY/kWh with a standard deviation of 0.6 JPY/kWh for a system with hydrogen storage. The calculations indicate that the required storage capacity is determined mainly by the duration of “windless and sunless” periods, or “dark doldrums”, and the greatest risk under high VRE penetrations is the possibility of supply disruption during such periods. The results also highlight the considerable value of “firm capacities”, such as thermal and nuclear power generation, under a high share of VRE, although it should be noted that the profitability of these capacities may differ significantly from current situations, with large VRE outputs with negligible marginal costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Unlike previous studies where models/methods used in determining the carbon emission are presented, in this paper, a detailed analysis of the causes, trends, and solutions to carbon emission in Africa is presented. Economic development plays a crucial role in the well-being of a country/continent, thereby, affecting energy consumption. The impact of economic development on Africa's carbon (CO2) emissions trend is first investigated. After which, three neural network models are developed to predict the future trend of total CO2 emission in the continent. Then, the use of renewable energy (RE) sources for power generation is analyzed/proposed as a viable solution for CO2 emission reduction in Africa. Finally, the impact of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) integration and hydrogen production in maximizing RE production in Africa's largest economy is analyzed. Secondary data of the economic indicators for twenty-five different African countries have been used to justify the effect of economic development on their carbon emission. From the results of the analyses, gross national income and carbon emissions in all sectors were found to be significantly positively correlated. That is, as national wealth across Africa increases, carbon emissions in the continent increase. Also, the predicted total annual CO2 emission showed that most countries will witness an increase in total CO2 emission by 2022 in comparison to 2018. The proposed RE-based method for power generation showed that the CO2 emission from the power industry can be reduced to zero for an African country. Nevertheless, the use of BEVs and the production of hydrogen will be integral in achieving this. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In the recent decade, the design of green hydrogen supply chains has been highlighted by researchers. Although, nowadays, responsiveness and social responsibility of networks could also be regarded as important measures that could attract more consumers to use hydrogen. Accordingly, this paper aims to improve the reliability and social responsibility of a hydrogen supply chain along with its economic and environmental aspects. To ensure the network's responsiveness, a new objective function is extended that maximizes the reliability of products' delivery. Also, a novel reliability approach is developed to immune the network against disruptions. As a new sustainability indicator, social factors are considered in the design of the hydrogen supply chain. Finally, a mixed possibilistic flexible programming method is proposed to assure the outputs' reliability. The results illustrate that by 28.4% enhancement in cost objective, the value of environmental, social, and reliability objectives are desirably improved 39.2%, 45.6%, and 24.1%, respectively. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The cost of renewable electricity is now below the cost of hydrocarbon-generated electricity, and low enough that it is economically sensible to produce fuels using renewable electricity (Power-to-X). Aluminum is well suited to play the role of “X” in a power-to-X system. Aluminum possesses the characteristics that are most important for a sustainable energy carrier: high energy density, abundance, recyclability, and it is anticipated that the alumina-reduction process will soon be free of carbon emissions. Oxidation of aluminum yields a cycle efficiency of approximately 25% if the product(s) of oxidation are used to power a heat engine with an efficiency of 40%. This compares favourably to other proposed energy carriers, such as hydrogen and ammonia. These fuels yield cycle efficiencies of no more than 23% and 18% respectively, if the carbon-free production route is used to produce the hydrogen and ammonia. Aluminum fuel can be competitive with a $50 barrel of oil if the reduction process is powered by electricity priced at $26/MWh or less. © 2020},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is recognized as a key source of the sustainable energy solutions. The transportation sector is known as one of the largest fuel consumers of the global energy market. Hydrogen can become a promising fuel for sustainable transportation by providing clean, reliable, safe, convenient, customer friendly, and affordable energy. In this study, the possibility of hydrogen as the major fuel for transportation systems is investigated comprehensively based on the recent data published in the literature. Due to its several characteristic advantages, such as energy density, abundance, ease of transportation, a wide variety of production methods from clean and renewable fuels with zero or minimal emissions; hydrogen appears to be a great chemical fuel which can potentially replace fossil fuel use in internal combustion engines. In order to take advantage of hydrogen as an internal combustion engine fuel, existing engines should be redesigned to avoid abnormal combustion. Hydrogen use in internal combustion engines could enhance system efficiencies, offer higher power outputs per vehicle, and emit lower amounts of greenhouse gases. Even though hydrogen-powered fuel cells have lower emissions than internal combustion engines, they require additional space and weight and they are generally more expensive. Therefore, the scope of this study is hydrogen-fueled internal combustion engines. It is also highlighted that in order to become a truly sustainable and clean fuel, hydrogen should be produced from renewable energy and material resources with zero or minimal emissions at high efficiencies. In addition, in this study, conventional, hybrid, electric, biofuel, fuel cell, and hydrogen fueled ICE vehicles are comparatively assessed based on their CO2 and SO2 emissions, social cost of carbon, energy and exergy efficiencies, fuel consumption, fuel price, and driving range. The results show that when all of these criteria are taken into account, fuel cell vehicles have the highest average performance ranking (4.97/10), followed by hydrogen fueled ICEs (4.81/10) and biofuel vehicles (4.71/10). On the other hand, conventional vehicles have the lowest average performance ranking (1.21/10), followed by electric vehicles (4.24/10) and hybrid vehicles (4.53/10). © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The weather-dependent electricity generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RES), such as solar and wind power, entails that systems for energy storage are becoming progressively more important. Among the different solutions that are being explored, hydrogen is currently considered as a key technology allowing future long-term and large-scale storage of renewable power. Today, hydrogen is mainly produced from fossil fuels, and steam methane reforming (SMR) is the most common route for producing it from natural gas. None of the conventional methods used is GHG-free. The Power-to-Gas concept, based on water electrolysis using electricity coming from renewable sources is the most environmentally clean approach. Given its multiple uses, hydrogen is sold both as a fuel, which can produce electricity through fuel cells, and as a feedstock in several industrial processes. Just the feedstock could be, in the short term, the main market of RES-based hydrogen. In this paper, we present the results obtained from a techno-economic-financial evaluation of a system to produce green hydrogen to be sold as a feedstock for industries and research centres. A system which includes a 200 kW photovoltaic plant and a 180 kW electrolyser, to be located in Messina (Italy), is proposed as a case study. According to the analyses carried out, and taking into account the current development of technologies, it has been found that investment to realise a small-scale PV-based hydrogen production plant can be remunerative. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

On the other hand, hydrogen is seen as future energy carrier because of its advantages. There are many options to benefit from hydrogen such as fuel cells, direct combustion, or store as gas or liquid. However, awareness of society of the renewable energy usage and also hydrogen as energy carrier is not sufficient.

The integration is performed by establishing a TEG instead of the condenser as power generation and cooling unit thereafter surplus power output of the TEG is transferred to the PEM electrolyzer for hydrogen production. The integrated renewable energy system is comprehensively modeled and influence of the effective parameters is investigated on exergy and economic indicators through the parametric study to better understand the system performance. Engineering equation solver (EES) as a potential engineering tool is used to simulate the system and obtain the desired results. In order to optimize the system, a developed multi-objective genetic algorithm MATLAB code is applied to determine the optimum operating conditions of the system. Obtained results demonstrate that at optimum working condition from exergy viewpoint, exergy efficiency and total cost are 12.76% and 61.69 $/GJ, respectively. Multi-objective optimization results further show that the final optimal point which is well-balanced between exergy efficiency and total cost, has the maximum exergy efficiency of 13.29% and total cost of 63.96 $/GJ, respectively. The corresponding values for exergy efficiency and total cost are 10.01% and 60.21 $/GJ for optimum working condition from economic standpoint. Furthermore, hydrogen production at well-balanced operating condition would be 2.28 kg/h. Eventually, the results indicate that establishing the TEG unit instead of the condenser is a promising method to optimize the performance of the system and reduce total cost. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Previous studies have noted the importance of electricity storage and hydrogen technologies for enabling large-scale variable renewable energy (VRE) deployment in long-term climate change mitigation scenarios. However, global studies, which typically use integrated assessment models, assume a fixed cost trajectory for storage and hydrogen technologies; thereby ignoring the sensitivity of VRE deployment and/or mitigation costs to uncertainties in future storage and hydrogen technology costs. Yet there is vast uncertainty in the future costs of these technologies, as reflected in the range of projected costs in the literature. This study uses the integrated assessment model, MESSAGE, to explore the implications of future storage and hydrogen technology costs for low-carbon energy transitions across the reported range of projected technology costs. Techno-economic representations of electricity storage and hydrogen technologies, including utility-scale batteries, pumped hydro storage (PHS), compressed air energy storage (CAES), and hydrogen electrolysis, are introduced to MESSAGE and scenarios are used to assess the sensitivity of long-term VRE deployment and mitigation costs across the range of projected technology costs. The results demonstrate that large-scale deployment of electricity storage technologies only occurs when techno-economic assumptions are optimistic. Although pessimistic storage and hydrogen costs reduce the deployment of these technologies, large VRE shares are supported in carbon-constrained futures by the deployment of other low-carbon flexible technologies, such as hydrogen combustion turbines and concentrating solar power with thermal storage. However, the cost of the required energy transition is larger. In the absence of carbon policy, pessimistic hydrogen and storage costs significantly decrease VRE deployment while increasing coal-based electricity generation. Thus, R&D investments that lower the costs of storage and hydrogen technologies are important for reducing emissions in the absence of climate policy and for reducing mitigation costs in the presence of climate policy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Energy is an enabler and a reliable energy supply is critical to sustainable socio-economic development for any nation. Most of Chad's people live in villages with no particular power supply system. Exploiting renewable energies is the only means of fostering development and improving people's welfare. This paper attempts at proposing an energy profile and storage model for Chad in vast remote towns. The paper addresses the key energy gap that is hindering on the development of such systems, it models and assess the potential on electricity generation and using hydrogen as surplus power storage system. A techno-econo-environmental survey on a solar-wind hybrid system in 25 towns in Chad is undertaken using NASA data and HOMER Software. Several hybrid scenarios of energy production and storage is analyzed. The results showed that in the electricity generation scenario, the average total NPC for the studied stations was $ 48164 and the average LCOE was $0.573. The lowest LCOE was related to Aouzou station with 0.507 $/kWh and the highest LCOE was obtained for Bol station with 0.604 $/kWh. In the simultaneous electricity and hydrogen generation scenario, the cheapest hydrogen ($4.695/kg) was produced in the “Grid” scenario, which was the same for all of the stations, with a total NPC of $2413770. The most expensive hydrogen ($4.707/kg) was generated in the “Grid-Wind” scenario and Bol stations with a total NPC of $2420186. The paper develops cost effective models for all hybrid systems combination for both electricity and hydrogen generation across Chad.

A new concept to control nuclear power production is posed in order to allow the regulation of the electricity sent to the grid. This concept proposes the joint operation of a nuclear power plant, a coal power plant with postcombustion capture and a methanation plant. The cost effectiveness of this technology and its capability to reduce the CO2 emissions -consumed in the methanation process- are assessed through the design and economic and environmental analysis of a hybrid facility. Mainly due to the increase of the operating hours of the coal-fired power plant, the environmental feasibility of the initial proposal seems to be limited. However, given that benefits are expected in the medium and long-term (2020–2030) for the Power to Gas facility, a future alternative use is proposed. The target of this new alternative configuration will be the storage of CO2 together with the storage of renewable energy. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {                             Currently, a significant transformation for energy systems has emerged as a result of the trend to develop an energy framework without fossil fuel reliance, the concerns about climate change and air quality, and the need to provide electricity to around of 17% of world population who lacks the service. Accordingly, the deployment of power plants located close to end-users and including multiple energy sources and carriers, along with the growing share of renewable energies, have suggested changes in the energy sector. Despite their potential capabilities, the design of distributed energy systems (DES) is a complex problem due to the simultaneous goals and constraints that need to be considered, as well as to the high context dependence of this kind of projects. For these reasons, in this work a systematic literature review of DES including hydrogen as energy vector, was made analyzing 106 research papers published between the years 2000–2018, and extracted from Scopus                             ®                              and Web of Science databases. The aim was to identify how hydrogen is employed (technologies, uses) and the criteria that are evaluated (economic, technical, social and environmental) when these systems are designed, planned and/or operated. The results constitute a baseline information covering the type of technologies, equipment sizes and hydrogen applications, that could be valuable for the preliminary stages of research or project planning of DES involving hydrogen. Furthermore, other factors have also been identified, such as the focus on techno-economic issues, and the lack of considering socio/political aspects and the uncertainty about input data like weather conditions, energy prices and demands. Additionally, a more integrated approach is needed including all the hydrogen supply chain stages and project stakeholders, to tackle issues like safety of the energy systems that could produce consumer rejections.                          © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The substantial expansion of renewable energy sources is creating the foundation to successfully transform the German energy sector (the so-called ‘Energiewende’). A by-product of this development is the corresponding capacity demand for the transportation, distribution and storage of energy. Hydrogen produced by electrolysis offers a promising solution to these challenges, although the willingness to invest in hydrogen technologies requires the identification of competitive and climate-friendly pathways in the long run. Therefore, this paper employs a pathway analysis to investigate the use of renewable hydrogen in the German passenger car transportation sector in terms of varying market penetration scenarios for fuel cell-electric vehicles (FCEVs). The investigation focuses on how an H2 infrastructure can be designed on a national scale with various supply chain networks to establish robust pathways and important technologies, which has not yet been done. Therefore, the study includes all related aspects, from hydrogen production to fueling stations, for a given FCEV market penetration scenario, as well as the CO2 reduction potential that can be achieved for the transport sector. A total of four scenarios are considered, estimating an FCEV market share of 1–75% by the year 2050. This corresponds to an annual production of 0.02–2.88 million tons of hydrogen. The findings show that the most cost-efficient H2 supply (well-to-tank: 6.7–7.5 €/kgH2)can be achieved in high demand scenarios (FCEV market shares of 30% and 75%)through a combination of cavern storage and pipeline transport. For low-demand scenarios, however, technology pathways involving LH2 and LOHC truck transport represent the most cost-efficient options (well-to-tank: 8.2–11.4 €/kgH2). © 2019},

	abstract = {Ongoing and emerging renewable energy technologies mainly produce electric energy and intermittent power. As the energy economy relies on banking energy, there is a rising need for chemically stored energy. We propose heat driven reverse electrodialysis (RED) technology with ammonium bicarbonate (AmB) as salt for producing hydrogen. The study provides the authors’ perspective on the commercial feasibility of AmB RED for low grade waste heat (333 K–413 K) to electricity conversion system. This is to our best of knowledge the only existing study to evaluate levelized cost of energy of a RED system for hydrogen production. The economic assessment includes a parametric study, and a scenario analysis of AmB RED system for hydrogen production. The impact of various parameters including membrane cost, membrane lifetime, cost of heating, inter-membrane distance and residence time are studied. The results from the economic study suggests, RED system with membrane cost less than 2.86 €/m2, membrane life more than 7 years and a production rate of 1.19 mol/m2/h or more are necessary for RED to be economically competitive with the current renewable technologies for hydrogen production. Further, salt solubility, residence time and inter-membrane distance were found to have impact on levelized cost of hydrogen, LCH. In the present state, use of ammonium bicarbonate in RED system for hydrogen production is uneconomical. This may be attributed to high membrane cost, low (0.72 mol/m2/h) hydrogen production rate and large (1,281,436 m2) membrane area requirements. There are three scenarios presented the present scenario, market scenario and future scenario. From the scenario analysis, it is clear that membrane cost and membrane life in present scenario controls the levelized cost of hydrogen. In market scenario and future scenario the hydrogen production rate (which depends on membrane properties, inter-membrane distance etc.), the cost of regeneration system and the cost of heating controls the levelized cost of hydrogen. For a thermally driven RED system to be economically feasible, the membrane cost not more than 20 €/m2; hydrogen production rate of 3.7 mol/m2/h or higher and cost of heating not more than 0.03 €/kWh for low grade waste heat to hydrogen production. © 2019 The Author(s)},

Also, hydrogen storage system (HSS) as an energy storage system (ESS) is used to cope with variable nature of RESs in which the concepts of power to hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen to power (H2P) are defined. In this work, a risk-averse stochastic operation of HSS and WG is modeled using a scenario-based stochastic approach by considering price-responsive demand response (DR) program. All uncertainties are modeled via a scenario-based stochastic approach while the risk related uncertainties are modeled via the downside risk constraints (DRC) to capture the risk-averse operation of the HSS and WG. In order to investigate the impact of DRC implementation, a risk-averse strategy is compared versus risk-neutral strategy. Compared results show that the risk-in-cost (RIC) is reduced while the expected operation cost (EOC) is raised to deal with the risk of the uncertainty. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The cost of large scale hydrogen production from electrolysis is dominated by the cost of electricity, representing 77–89% of the total costs. The integration of low-cost renewable energy is thus essential to affordable and clean hydrogen production from electrolysis. Flexible operation of electrolysis and hydro power can facilitate integration of remote energy resources by providing the flexibility that is needed in systems with large amounts of variable renewable energy. The flexibility from hydro power is limited by the physical complexities of the river systems and ecological concerns which makes the flexibility not easily quantifiable. In this work we investigate how different levels of flexibility from hydro power affects the cost of hydrogen production. We develop a two-stage stochastic model in a rolling horizon framework that enables us to consider the uncertainty in wind power production, energy storage and the structure of the energy market when simulating power system operation. This model is used for studying hydrogen production from electrolysis in a future scenario of a remote region in Norway with large wind power potential. A constant demand of hydrogen is assumed and flexibility in the electrolysis operation is enabled by hydrogen storage. Different levels of hydro power flexibility are considered by following a reservoir guiding curve every hour, 6 h or 24 h. Results from the case study show that hydrogen can be produced at a cost of 1.89 €/kg in the future if hydro power production is flexible within a period of 24 h, fulfilling industry targets. Flexible hydrogen production also contributes to significantly reducing wasted energy from spillage from reservoirs or wind power curtailment by up to 56% for 24 h of flexibility. The results also show that less hydro power flexibility results in increased flexible operation of the electrolysis plant where it delivers 39–46% more regulating power, operates more on higher power levels and stores more hydrogen. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {According to IEA projections, the penetration of electric vehicles in the world transportation sector is expected to increase in the next decades to comply with the future GHG emissions policy targets. The change in transport technology mix will cause a change the environmental and economic impacts of the transportation sector, switching it from flows to funds, that is, from the production and use of the fuel to the production of the fuel pathway and powertrain infrastructures. Therefore, due to their comprehensiveness, the use of Life Cycle Assessment models will be increasingly important with respect to Well-to-Wheels ones in assessing the impact of future transport technologies. In this paper, the Hybrid Input-Output analysis is proposed as the appropriate framework to assess the impact due to a change in transport technology mix from a LCA perspective. First, LCA and WTW approaches are theoretically compared. Secondly, the LCA model is applied for the analysis of the economic and environmental impact caused by the prospected penetration of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) based on Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) for Germany in 2050. In addition to the production of the vehicles, the LCA model includes the infrastructures for hydrogen production and distribution and the prospected change in the national electricity production mix. Significant discrepancies have been found by comparing results of LCA with the ones obtained by well-established WTW models already available in the literature. It is found that the impact caused by infrastructures and production of vehicles could significantly offset the expected reduction in CO2 emissions and primary non-renewable energy consumptions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Generally, wind to power conversion is calculated by assuming the quality of wind as measured with a Weibull probability distribution at wind speed during power generation. We build on this method by modifying the Weibull distributions to reflect the actual range of wind speeds and wind energy density. This was combined with log law that modifies wind speed based on the height from the ground, to derive the wind power potential at windy sites. The study also provides the Levelized cost of renewable energy and hydrogen conversion capacity at the proposed sites. We have also electrolyzed the wind-generated electricity to measure the production capacity of renewable hydrogen. We found that all the sites considered are commercially viable for hydrogen production from wind-generated electricity. Wind generated electricity cost varies from $0.0844 to $0.0864 kW h, and the supply cost of renewable hydrogen is $5.30 to $ 5.80/kg-H2. Based on the findings, we propose a policy on renewable hydrogen fueled vehicles so that the consumption of fossil fuels could be reduced.

	abstract = {So far, the biggest photovoltaic park in Belgium has been injecting all its energy into the electric distribution grid through a power purchase agreement with an electricity supplier. Due to decreasing and volatile wholesale electricity prices, the industrial partners/owners of the photovoltaic park are considering hydrogen storage in an attempt to increase the value proposition of their renewable energy installation. A major objective of the present work is to show how the utilization factor of the electrolyzer is affected by the design of the power supply system when the latter consists only of renewable energy sources instead of using the electric grid. Different hybrid designs were developed, by combining the existing photovoltaic source with wind power and state-of-the-art energy storage technologies (Vanadium Redox Flow or Lithium NMC). Finally, four scenarios were investigated, all considering a 1 MW PEM electrolyzer: A) 15 MW PV, B) 15 MW PV, 2MW Wind, C) 15 MW PV, 2 MW Wind, Battery, D) 15 MW PV, 15 MW Wind. The utilization factor was found as follows, for each scenario respectively: A) 41,5%, B) 65,5%, C) 66,0–86,0%, D) 82,0%. Furthermore, the analysis was extended to include economic evaluations (i.e. payback period, accumulated profit), specifically concerning scenario B and C. The results of this study lead to a number of conclusions such as: i) The utilization of the electrolyzer is limited when its power supply is intermittent. ii) Compared to PV, wind power makes larger contribution to the increase of the utilization factor, iii) 100% utilization can be achieved only if an energy storage system co-exists. iv) With a utilization factor at 65,5% scenario B can deliver a payback period in less than 8 years, if hydrogen is sold above 5€/kg.

The hourly operation of the cavern has been modeled. The electricity supply is restricted to wind and grid electricity only. The mobility market is clearly the key driver, both in quantity and economic terms, with an easier to achieve target cost (€4/kgH2, ex-storage). High utilization rates of electrolysers are necessary to reach profitability. A need for massive storage begins for a renewable penetration rate of 50%.

	abstract = {While macroscopic modelling and dynamic analyses are topics approached by many to improve the efficiency of hybrid energy systems, the optimization and control of operational strategies need to be studied to allow practicality of such configurations in an industrial setting. Simple implementation and reliable operability of any critical sub-system component of a hybrid energy module are critical requirements for the development of their control algorithms. In this paper, a state-of-the-art hybrid renewable energy system consist of different sub-systems is presented with resolved economically optimal dispatch strategies. The local control of one of its key exemplary sub-system, a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC), is realized via two methods i.e. a model-based approach of shrinking-horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) with constraints and a data-driven approach using Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) to identify controller parameters. Fixed current load and fixed conversion efficiency operations are assessed respectively for 1-h and 24-h spans. For both simulation cases, results show that both control methods provide robust power tracking performance within constrained boundaries with marginal to no overshoot and the VRFT method achieving stability at least 10 times faster than the MPC method. While the two juxtaposed methods are diametrically different, they are both technically viable and efficient under industrial power loads. The main contribution of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of the hybrid energy system by providing the practitioners with a broad range of local control options, depending on operational realities and constraints. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Power-to-gas and other chemicals-based storages are often suggested for energy systems with high shares of variable renewable energy. Here we study the North European power and district heat system with alternative long-term storage, the power-to-ammonia (P2A) technology. Assuming fully renewable power and heat sectors and large-scale electrification of road transport, we perform simultaneous optimization of capacity investments and dispatch scheduling of wind, solar, hydro and thermal power, energy storages as well as transmission, focusing on year 2050. We find that P2A has three major roles: it provides renewable feedstock to fertilizer industry and it contributes significantly to system balancing over both time (energy storage) and space (energy transfer). The marginal cost of power-based ammonia production in the studied scenarios varied between 431 and 528 €/t, which is in the range of recent ammonia prices. Costs of P2A plants were dominated by electrolysis. In the power and heat sector, with our cost assumptions, P2A becomes competitive compared to fossil natural gas only if gas price or CO2 emission price rises above 70 €/MWh or 200 €/tCO2. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The potential of both long-term (hydrogen storage) and short-term (batteries and thermal) storage systems in decentralized neighbourhoods are assessed using a multi-objective optimization approach that minimizes both costs and CO2 emissions. A method is developed, which evaluates the performance of long and short-term storage systems in the future based on multi-objective optimization. More specifically, hydrogen storage is investigated for its future potential to be used as a long-term storage in a decentralized context and it is compared with short-term storage systems such as batteries and thermal storage. In order to analyze potential future developments, a scenario approach is deployed based on the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change's ‘Special Report on Emissions Scenarios’. Three future scenarios are defined and simulated for the years of 2015, 2020, 2035, and 2050 for both a rural and an urban neighbourhood in Switzerland. Based on the scenarios, the energy demand and renewable potential projections until 2050 are simulated including retrofitted buildings and renewable potential in the neighbourhoods. The Pareto front of solutions is then benchmarked against national carbon and energy targets from 2020 until 2050. In addition, a range of parameter assumptions (e.g., for economic variables, policy changes, environmental conditions) are used in each scenario to incorporate uncertainty into the analysis. The long-term storage potential of hydrogen, in particular, is evaluated for its capability to shift renewable surpluses in summer towards demand later in the year. From the results, it is predicted that neighbourhoods with high renewable surpluses (i.e., in rural settings) should consider the advantages of a hydrogen storage system from 2035 to 2050. For neighbourhoods with low surpluses, short-term battery and thermal storage systems are predicted to be sufficient for load shifting. It is also observed that a high feed-in remuneration undermines on-site consumption, thus resulting in lower levels of storage deployment due the selling of production back to the centralized electricity grid. Lastly, it is concluded that both an increase in renewable technology deployment and in the retrofit rate of buildings will both be required to meet energy targets for the two case studies. As the renewable potential in urban contexts is limited, it is particularly important for older building stock to be retrofitted at a high rate (more than 2% of buildings per year) in order to reduce the end energy demand of the buildings. The approach used in this article is widely applicable both in spatial scope (e.g., other decentralized energy systems, geographies) and temporal scope (e.g., different years, scenarios) and allows for an optimization with a range of objective functions, thus making it an effective approach to identify the renewable and storage technologies that can contribute to most of the decarbonization of the building stock in the future. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rising share of electricity from renewable energy sources results in a need for long-term storage options to balance load and volatile supply in the future. A promising option for the long-term storage of surplus electricity is the production of hydrogen from water and its reconversion to generate electricity. An economic way to implement this reconversion in the near future is proposed in this paper. The designed engine process allows for efficient zero-emission combustion of hydrogen with pure oxygen, which is available as a byproduct of hydrolysis. To limit the high temperatures that arise during stoichiometric combustion of hydrogen and oxygen, the engine process has been combined with a steam cycle, resulting in temperatures not exceeding those in common diesel engines. The resulting two-stage process uses part of the exhaust gas energy for evaporation and overheating in a steam cycle. The exhaust gas energy is partly recovered and the required compression work is provided by a pump rather than a compression stroke, leading to higher efficiencies than in existing hydrogen internal combustion engines. The designed process consists of a two-stroke engine cycle and has been modeled as a standard cycle using real gas data and considering charge cycle losses, wall heat losses and mechanical losses. With an assumed maximum cylinder pressure of 150 bar, the process can achieve an effective efficiency of more than 50%. With an achievable power density almost twice as high as in conventional hydrogen engines this concept is quite promising. However, there are some challenges with regard to oil-free lubrication, high combustion temperatures and high-pressure injection of hydrogen and oxygen, which require further research. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Being produced from renewable energy, hydrogen is one of the most efficient energy carriers of the future. Using metal alloys, hydrogen can be stored and transported at a low cost, in a safe and effective manner. However, most metals react with hydrogen to form a compound called metal hydride (MH). This reaction is an exothermic process, and as a result releases heat. With sufficient heat supply, hydrogen can be released from the as-formed metal hydride. In this work, we propose an integrated power system of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) together with a hydride tank designed for vehicle use. We investigate different aspects for developing metal hydride tanks and their integration in the PEMFC, using water as the thermal fluid and a FeTi intermetallic compound as the hydrogen storage material. Ground truth simulations show that the annular metal hydride tank meets the hydrogen requirements of the fuel cell, but to the detriment of the operating temperature of the fuel cell (FC). © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Biogas upgraded to biomethane can provide a renewable gaseous transport fuel and is one of the proposed solutions in meeting the renewable energy supply in transport targets set under the EU Renewable Energy Directive. The upgrading process for biogas involves the removal of CO2. Amine scrubbing is one traditional method of upgrading that is applied due to its low methane slippage and its capability to provide a high purity renewable methane product. However, new technologies such as power to gas (P2G) can also upgrade biogas through biological methanation by combining the CO2 in biogas with H2 to produce renewable methane. The H2 for P2G can be produced through electrolysis of renewable electricity. Through simulation software – SuperPro Designer, the economics of different pathways for upgrading biogas from a grass silage and slurry fed digester are analysed and compared in this paper. Three scenarios were investigated: biogas upgrading through amine scrubbing (scenario 1); biogas upgrading through amine scrubbing with CO2 directed to ex-situ biological methanation (scenario 2) and biogas upgrading through ex-situ biological methanation only (scenario 3). The results show that at a net present value of zero, the minimum selling price (MSP) per m3 of renewable methane for scenario 1, 2 and 3 is €0.76; €1.50 and €1.43, respectively (with an electricity price to produce H2 of €0.10/kWh and a grass silage production cost of €27/t). The electricity price has a significant effect on the cost of renewable methane in both scenarios 2 and 3. The MSP reduces to €1.09 and €1.00 per m3 of renewable methane, respectively for scenarios 2 and 3, if the electricity price is reduced to €0.05/kWh. Since the renewable methane MSP from scenario 2 is higher than scenario 3, it is suggested that direct biogas injection to the methanation reactor is financially more attractive than capturing CO2 from biogas and feeding it to the methanation step. The MSP of renewable methane from both scenarios 2 and 3 are significantly higher than that of scenario 1. However, when considering climate change mitigation, balancing of the electricity network and storage of surplus electricity, utilising P2G can offset some of these costs. The cost of H2 is a significant factor in determining the cost of renewable methane. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to the significance of hybrid energy systems, selecting the appropriate sizing-energy management strategy combination represents a key factor to ensure the efficient operation while offering a competitive operating cost. This paper presents an integrated framework for finding the best size-energy management strategy combination for a hybrid energy system. Fundamental to this framework is utilizing finite automata to develop multiple energy management strategies that fully take into consideration the dynamic relationship between all the assets in the hybrid energy system. The proposed integrated framework consists of three main steps. First, an analytical and economic sizing approach is performed to find the initial sizes of the hybrid energy system assets based on an initial energy management strategy; second, using finite automata to implement the initial energy management strategy and instantiate different energy management strategies; and third, an evaluation model is developed to assess the instantiated energy management strategies and extract the featured conditions to create new-improved one. This new energy management strategy is used to re-exercise the analytical and economic sizing to obtain the best size-energy management strategy combination. The novelty in this work can be summarized as taking the impact of selecting the right energy management strategy on the sizing of a hybrid energy management. This can lead to better performance and can be explained in our integrated framework by reducing the cost, reducing the diesel generator and fuel cell working hours and increasing the photovoltaic utilization. Moreover, using finite automata in implementing and instantiating multiple energy management strategies to attain an improved one has not been reported. A comparison between the results of the proposed framework and the results of the analytical and economic sizing approach is carried out. The size of the photovoltaic is reduced from 140 kW to 60 kW when using the integrated framework and therefore the size of the electrolyzer and the hydrogen tank reduced to the half. Moreover, a reduction in the diesel generator working hours by 35% and in the levelized cost of energy by 40% are achieved. © 2019},

The present study involves the simple synthesis of nanostructured nickel selenide (NiSe) via a hydrothermal method. The different phases of nickel selenide and their dependency on the precursor concentration were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The morphologies of coral-like structured pure and Mo-doped NiSe (Ni1-xMoxSe) samples were investigated systematically using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The as-prepared Ni0.5Mo0.5Se material showed an enhanced electrochemical activity of 1.57 V @ 10 mA/cm2 for OER and 0.19 V @ 10 mA/cm2 to HER, and follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky for HER mechanism. In addition, the electrocatalyst exhibits a large electrochemical surface area and high stability.

	abstract = {A large volume of wind power is curtailed worldwide due to the intermittency and limited transportation capacity of electrical power systems. New technologies, Power-to-Gas via electrolysis, can convert excessive wind power into hydrogen to be transported by natural gas systems. However, the injection of H2 into natural gas pipelines can cause gas quality issues due to changing gas compositions. This paper investigates the impact of injecting H2 converted from wind power on natural gas quality. Two key indexes used to measure gas quality, Wobbe Index and Combustion Potential, are introduced to examine the impact. Then, in order to bring the two indexes into acceptable statutory ranges, H2 is mixed with Liquid Petroleum Gas and Nitrogen. A robust optimization model, considering wind power uncertainties, is thereafter developed to manage the gas mixture, maximize H2 injection. This paper uses the dynamic gas system model to represent real-time pipeline flows, which can better reflect gas flow features over time. The proposed method is demonstrated on a small integrated gas-electricity system. Results illustrate that excessive H2 injection will reduce Wobbe Index but increase Combustion Potential. The robust optimization approach can effectively manage the mixture while ensuring gas quality with an uncertain wind power supply. The proposed method is beneficial to reducing renewable energy curtailment and maximizing H2 injection, benefiting electricity system operators with low operation costs and wind power more penetration. © 2018},

	abstract = {Power-to-Gas technologies offer a promising approach for converting renewable electricity into a molecular form (fuel) to serve the energy demands of non-electric energy applications in all end-use sectors. The technologies have been broadly developed and are at the edge of a mass roll-out. The barriers that Power-to-Gas faces are no longer technical, but are, foremost, regulatory, and economic. This study focuses on a Power-to-Gas pathway, where electricity is first converted in a water electrolyzer into hydrogen, which is then synthetized with carbon dioxide to produce synthetic natural gas. A key aspect of this pathway is that an intermittent electricity supply could be used, which could reduce the amount of electricity curtailment from renewable energy generation. Interim storages would then be necessary to decouple the synthesized part from hydrogen production, to enable (I) longer continuous operation cycles for the methanation reactor, and (II) increased annual full-load hours, leading to an overall reduction in gas production costs. This work optimizes a Power-to-Gas plant configuration with respect to the cost benefits using a Monte Carlo-based simulation tool. The results indicate potential cost reductions of up to 17% in synthetic natural gas production by implementing well-balanced components and interim storages. This study also evaluates three different power sources which differ greatly in their optimal system configuration. Results from time-resolved simulations and sensitivity analyses for different plant designs and electricity sources are discussed with respect to technical and economic implications, so as to facilitate a plant design process for decision makers. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Strong efforts are necessary to stem climate change. It requires to switch to renewable fuels. But as energy demand in Central Europe is high, renewable energy resources are of moderate quality, and available potentials are limited, energy imports from areas with beneficial renewable resources – such as North Africa – might be a promising option. Against this background this paper investigates the costs and potentials for hydrogen produced on the basis of electricity from wind and solar energy in North Africa and the subsequent transport as a blend with natural gas in existing pipelines. Linear optimization using hourly wind and solar data yields minimum hydrogen production cost. 2419 locations covering a 2° proximity of the existing natural gas pipeline infrastructure are considered in a lower and higher cost case for a near-term future (ca. 2020). Modell results provide lowest hydrogen production cost of 45 resp. 99 €/MWh. The production potential is in the range of PWh/a and therefore exceeds the hydrogen that can be transported in the existing infrastructure: Operating pipelines are potentially able to carry 10 vol% hydrogen in the natural gas feed with negligible adjustments to the infrastructure so that 9.5–23.2 TWh/a of hydrogen can be transported to Europe at minimum transport costs of 9 resp. 19 €/MWh. As these transport costs are low, supplying hydrogen leads to lower cost than transforming it to methane, Diesel or gasoline and is therefore the cheapest form of supplying a power based fuel. The hydrogen costs sum up to supply costs of 54 resp. 119 €/MWh free Central Europe. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Power-to-gas (P2G) is a promising enabling technology for more cross-sector integration but its high cost has so far been a key barrier to implementation. Electricity supply is the greatest contributor to the levelised cost therefore it is important to understand which technologies and strategies can minimise the cost and accelerate the deployment. In this study, a method is devised to evaluate the cost and value of combined systems comprising P2G and renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaics, wind and hydro as well as comparing to traditional electricity supply via the wholesale market. The proposed models are based on a temporal resolution of 1 h and include partial operation and ageing throughout the system's lifespan. Our analysis covers both distributed and centralised P2G systems producing hydrogen or methane as well as various value-adding services across different geographies. It is found that the capacity factor of a P2G system drives the economic case and therefore the electricity supply from hydropower plants is economically more attractive than electricity from wind and solar photovoltaic plants in this order. Under today's market conditions, it is highly advisable to combine local renewable supply with wholesale-based supply but interestingly, a 20% capital cost reduction in wind technology or a P2G system efficiency of 80% are break-even points for P2G systems producing hydrogen and connected to wind plants. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources (RES) will play a crucial role in future sustainable energy systems. In scenarios analyzing future energy system designs, a detailed spatial and temporal representation of renewable-based electricity generation is essential. For this, sufficiently representative weather data are required. Most analyses performed in this context use the historical data of either one specific reference year or an aggregation of multiple years. In contrast, this study analyzes the impact of different weather years based on historical weather data from 1980 through 2016 in accordance with the design of an exemplary future energy system. This exemplary energy system consists of on- and offshore wind energy for power-to-hydrogen via electrolysis, including hydrogen pipeline transport for most southwestern European countries. The assumed hydrogen demand for transportation needs represents a hypothetical future market penetration for fuel cell-electric vehicles of 75%. An optimization framework is used in order to evaluate the resulting system design with the objective function of minimizing the total annual cost (TAC) of the system. For each historical weather year, the applied optimization model determines the required capacities and operation of wind power plants, electrolyzers, storage technologies and hydrogen pipelines to meet the assumed future hydrogen demand in a highly spatially- and temporally-detailed manner, as well as the TAC of the system. Following that, the results of every individual year are compared in terms of installed capacities, overall electricity generation and connection to the transmission network, as well as the cost of these components within each region. The results reveal how sensitive the final design of the exemplary system is to the choice of the weather year. For example, the TAC of the system changes by up to 20% across two consecutive weather years. Furthermore, significant variation in the optimization results regarding installed capacities per region with respect to the choice of weather years can be observed. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The deployment of low-emission alternative fuels is crucial to decarbonise the transport sector. A number of alternatives like hydrogen or dimethyl ether/methanol synthesised using CO2 as feedstock for fuel production (hereafter refer to “CO2-based fuels”) have been proposed to combat climate change. However, the decarbonisation potential of CO2-based fuels is under debate because CO2 is re-emitted to the atmosphere when the fuel is combusted; and the majority of hydrogen still relies on fossil resources, which makes its prospects of being a low-carbon fuel dependent on its manufacturing process. First, this paper investigates the relative economic and environmental performance of hydrogen (produced from conventional steam methane reforming and produced via electrolysis using renewable energy), and CO2-based fuels (dimethyl ether and methanol), considering the full carbon cycle. The results reveal that hydrogen produced from steam methane reforming is the most economical option and that hydrogen produced via electrolysis using renewables has the best environmental profile. Whereas the idea of CO2-based fuels has recently gained much interest, it has for the foreseeable future rather limited practical relevance since there is no favourable combination of cost and environmental performance. This will only change in the long run and requires that CO2 is of non-fossil origin, i.e. from biomass combustion or captured from air. Second, this paper address unresolved methodological issues in the assessment of CO2-based fuels, such as the possible allocation of emissions to the different sectors involved. The outcomes indicate that implementing different allocation approaches substantially influences the carbon footprint of CO2-based fuels. To avoid allocation issues, expanding the boundaries including the entire system and is therefore recommended. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper analyses the potential of the Power-to-Gas (PtG) concept in Baden-Württemberg (BW), south west Germany. A macroeconomic analysis shows that a cost-covering operation of PtG for hydrogen production is first possible under our assumptions in 2030. Previous model-based analyses for Germany identified locations, mainly in north-west Germany, where these plants could achieve these full load hours and thus be economical in the future energy system by 2040. Importantly, although some short-term storage devices (batteries) are installed in BW in this scenario, no PtG plants are seen at the level of the transport network. A more detailed analysis for BW at the municipality level develops residual load profiles for individual 110 kV transformers and municipalities. A very large increase in the residual load profiles in the north-east of Baden-Württemberg by 2040 is encountered, suggesting a requirement for network strengthening and local storage, including PtG, in this area. Four very different and representative model regions are further analysed, whereby only Aalen, a region with large wind potentials in the north east of BW, is identified as having significant potentials for PtG by 2040 (between 69 and 155 MWel). The current restrictions for injecting hydrogen into the gas network (2–10% by volume) mean that these PtG plants would have to incorporate a methanation step in order to upgrade and feed in SNG. The generation of SNG on a local level is therefore expected to be an option by about 2040, if the development of renewable energy generation proceeds as quickly as expected in the current energy-political scenario explored here. The existing CO2 sources for methanation are not located in the vicinity of the expected PtG plants, so that a CO2 separation from the air and/or a liquefied transport could be most economical. Further work is required to consider the local energy infrastructure, especially electrical and gas distribution networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Because of highly increasing energy consumption, environmental issues and lack of common energy sources, the use of renewable energy sources especially wind power generation technology is increasing with significant growth in the world. But due to the variable nature of these sources, new challenges have been created in the balance between production and consumption of power system. The hydrogen energy storage (HES) system by storing excess wind power through the technology of power to hydrogen (P2H) and delivering it to the electricity network through hydrogen-based gas turbine at the required hours reduces not only wind alternation but can play an important role in balancing power production and consumption. On the other hand, power consumers by participating in demand response (DR) programs can reduce their consumption at peak load or wind power shortage hours, and increase their consumption at low-load or excess wind power hours to reduce wind power spillage and system energy cost. This paper proposes a stochastic security constrained unit commitment (SCUC) with wind energy considering coordinated operation of price-based DR and HES system. Price-based DR has been formulated as a price responsive shiftable demand bidding mechanism. The proposed model has been tested on modified 6-bus and 24-bus systems. The numerical results show the effect of simultaneous consideration of HES system and price-based DR integrated with wind energy on hourly generation scheduling of thermal units. As a result there is some reduction in wind generation power spillage and daily operation cost. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {With regard to the Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011 and Japan's goal to reduce CO2 emission, the Japanese government strives for an emission free “hydrogen society” in which hydrogen will be the primary energy medium. The import of hydrogen generated by means of CO2 free wind electricity from overseas can be a promising option for Japan's prospective energy supply. Besides different other factors like specific costs of electrolyzers and hydrogen shipment over long distances, the economically reasonable export of hydrogen based on renewable energy requires low levelized costs of electricity. Within the scope of this study, the underlying idea of a hydrogen supply chain is taken up and revisited by means of a spatially highly resolved wind energy potential analysis and a detailed investigation of the supply chain elements between Patagonia and Japan. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of the total land area in Patagonia would be eligible. Approx. 33,000 turbines with a minimum number of 4500 full-load hours with an overall capacity of about 115 GW can be positioned. Taking into consideration the related average number of 4750 full-load hours and an electrolysis efficiency of 0.7, this leads to a potential production of about 11.5 million tons/year of hydrogen. So the wind power potential of Patagonia would theoretically be sufficient for the assumed Japanese hydrogen demand of 8.83 million tons/year. The total hydrogen pretax cost would amount to approx. 4.40 €/kgH2 at a liquid state at the harbor of Yokohama. Hence, the final specific costs of hydrogen in Japan depend on the expansion of wind power in Patagonia and therefore hydrogen based on wind energy can be cost-competitive to conventional fuels. © 2018},

	abstract = {The publication gives an overview of the production costs of synthetic methane in a Power-to-Gas process. The production costs depend in particularly on the electricity price and the full load hours of the plant sub-systems electrolysis and methanation. The full-load hours of electrolysis are given by the electricity supply concept. In order to increase the full-load hours of methanation, the size of the intermediate hydrogen storage tank and the size of the methanation are optimised on the basis of the availability of hydrogen. The calculation of the production costs for synthetic methane are done with economics for 2030 and 2050 and the expenditures are calculated for one year of operation. The sources of volume of purchased electricity are the short-term market, long-term contracts, direct-coupled renewable energy sources or seasonal use of surpluses. Gas sales are either traded on the short-term market or guaranteed by long-term contracts. The calculations show, that an intermediate storage tank for hydrogen, adjustment of the methanation size and operating electrolysis and methanation separately, increase the workload of the sub-system methanation. The gas production costs can be significantly reduced. With the future expected development of capital expenditures, operational expenditure, electricity prices, gas costs and efficiencies, an economic production of synthetic natural gas for the years 2030, especially for 2050, is feasible. The results show that Power-to-Gas is an option for long-term, large-scale seasonal storage of renewable energy. Especially the cases with high operating hours for the sub-system methanation and low electricity prices show gas production costs below the expected market prices for synthetic gas and biogas. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {Against the background of diminishing traditional energy sources, increasing negative impact on the environment, also due to some energy sectors, as well as the growing threat of extreme increase in the waste on a global scale, SRES have a serious potential to play the role of one of the key methods to achieve a sustainable balance, without any harm to the economic development. In practice, if assumed that the total population of the Earth is 7 billion people, at least 5 million tons of waste is generated on a daily basis (not counting the industrial ones). Of them, circa 2 million tons are non-recyclable, but these could be transformed into energy. Modern technologies offer up to 50% conversion of the source materials into useable free energy––i.e. there is a potential for the generation of approximately 1 million МW/h per day, or at least 300–350 TW/h per annum. This amounts to the whole electricity consumption of 5–10 small developed countries like Bulgaria, Slovenia, etc. The improvement and implementation of the SRES technologies will require significant expenses for scientific research and development. A part of these expenses can be covered by the general provision of incentives for alternative energy sources, another part should be provided by external sources, including funding from the central budgets, grants, as part of public-private partnerships, etc. The offered article examines the economics of the SRES, and all related factors, including their role and place in the energy sector, significance for the protection of the environment and for the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs), adopted within the UN. An attempt is made to develop the existing and to offer new criteria for a more accurate and universal definition of the SRES. The objective of the article is not to claim to be an universal and exhaustive study of all aspects, related to the nature and use of the SRES, but it is rather an attempt to systematize and carry out a comparative analysis of the main problems, related to the SRES, as well as to draw the attention and stir a wider discussion on a topic, which––according to the authors––undeservedly fails to be sufficiently incorporated into the studies and research, related to the alternative energy development. Special attention is drawn to the opportunities provided by waste-to-hydrogen solutions alongside with other waste-to-energy approaches. Authors are also introducing for the first time the notion of “double-green-solution” as a specific feature of the waste-to-energy solutions.

	abstract = {This work aims to explore the electrification of chemical industry taking the production of methanol as a case study. A reference process, with a basis of 400,000 tonne per annum, is first simulated in Aspen Plus to produce methanol via traditional natural gas reforming. As an indirect electrification strategy, a non-conventional carbon dioxide hydrogenation methanol plant is then designed to substitute fossil fuel feedstock. Standalone heat-pumps are implemented as a direct electrification method in both processes at various extents generating different scenarios. It has been found that direct electrification has a small impact on energy consumption in all scenarios. In the reference process, direct electrification can only substitute 7.1 MW of heating, accounting for 7.8% of the total heating. In contrast, the energy structure of the indirectly electrified process is completely changed from the reference process: (1) very high temperature heating is eliminated; (2) electricity consumption is increased from 14.2 to 604.1 MW due to feedstock (hydrogen) synthesis. The renewable energy penetration and electricity price are taken into consideration when financial and environmental assessments are performed. At approximately 88% of renewable penetration, carbon neutrality is achieved in the indirectly electrified process. The net present value of the indirectly electrified process breaks even at an electricity price of 22 €/MWh and exceeds its counterpart reference process at 3–4 €/MWh. This analysis will enable the integration and management of renewable energy for methanol production and will facilitate future studies on the electrification of chemical production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Water electrolysis is the cleanest method for hydrogen production, and can be 100% green when renewable energy is used as electricity source. When the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is carried out in alkaline media, nickel (Ni) is a low cost catalyst and an interesting alternative to platinum. Still, its performance has to be enhanced to meet the high efficiency of the nobler metals, an objective that requires further tailoring of the surface area and morphology of Ni-based electrode materials. Unlike commercially available porous Ni, these features can be easily controlled via electrodeposition, a one-step process, taking advantage of the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT). Generally, changes in surface porosity and morphology have been mainly achieved by altering the main parameters, such as the current density or the deposition time. However, very scarce work has been done on the role of supporting electrolyte (i.e., its concentration and composition) in tailoring the foam features and consequently their catalytic activity. Hence, this approach paves the way to optimum design of metallic foam structures that can be obtained only with modifications in the electrolytic bath. In this work, 3D Ni foams are obtained from different composition baths by galvanostatic electrodeposition in the hydrogen evolution regime on stainless steel current collectors. Their porosity and morphology are analysed by optical microscopy and SEM. The electrochemical performance is evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, while catalytic activity towards HER and materials’ stability in 8 M KOH are tested using polarisation curves and chronoamperometry measurements, respectively. The recorded high currents and extended stability of the Ni foams with dendritic morphology demonstrate its outstanding performance, making it an attractive cathode material for HER in highly alkaline media. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The hydrogen is transported by a) the natural gas grid and reclaimed by the existing steam reformer, b) an own pipeline and c) hydrogen trailers. The analysis is applied to the city of Hamburg, Germany, for two scenarios of installed renewable energy capacities. The annual course of excess renewable power is modeled in a coupled system approach and the replaceable hydrogen mass flow rate is determined using measurement data from an existing refinery. Dynamic simulations are performed using an open-source Modelica® library. It is found that in all three alternative hydrogen supply chains CO2 emissions can be reduced and costs are increased compared to the reference case. Transporting hydrogen via the natural gas grid is the least efficient but achieves the highest emission reduction and is the most economical alternative for small to medium amounts of hydrogen. Using a hydrogen pipeline is the most efficient option and slightly cheaper for large amounts than employing the natural gas grid. Transporting hydrogen by trailers is not economical for single consumers and realizes the lowest CO2 reductions. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Detailed analysis of pathways to future sustainable energy systems is important in order to identify and overcome potential constraints and negative impacts and to increase the utility and speed of this transition. A key aspect of a shift to renewable energy technologies is their relatively higher metal intensities. In this study a bottom-up cost-minimizing energy model is used to calculate aggregate metal requirements in different energy technology including hydrogen and climate policy scenarios and under a range of assumptions reflecting uncertainty in future metal intensities, recycling rate and life time of energy technologies. Metal requirements are then compared to current production rates and resource estimates to identify potentially “critical” metals. Three technology pathways are investigated: 100 percent renewables, coal & nuclear and gas & renewables, each under the two different climate policies: net zero emissions satisfying the well-below 2 °C target and business as usual without carbon constraints, resulting together in six scenarios. The results suggest that the three different technology pathways lead to an almost identical degree of warming without any climate policy, while emissions peaks within a few decades with a 2 °C policy. The amount of metals required varies significantly in the different scenarios and under the various uncertainty assumptions. However, some can be deemed “critical” in all outcomes, including Vanadium. The originality of this study lies in the specific findings, and in the employment of an energy model for the energy-mineral nexus study, to provide better understanding for decision making and policy development. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study conducts a techno-economic analysis to seek the feasibility to integrate a zero-emission building (ZEB) with a commercial-scale hydrogen vehicle (HV). The parametric analysis is conducted in 16 simulation groups with respect to the equipment options of the solar thermal collectors, the ground source heat pump (GSHP) and the HV refueling methods, while each group contains a series of cases with a range of on-site renewable electricity (REe) generation capacities between 0 and 16 kW. The assessment criteria include the annual operational equivalent CO2 emission and the relative net present value (NPVrel). By the parametric analysis, the sets of the non-dominated cases within the cloud of the analysed solutions have been comprehensively investigated regarding the aims to reduce the emission and the cost. With respect to the criteria of the equivalent emission and NPVrel under the normal market scenario of the electrolyzer (5000 EUR/kW), none of the cases with the on-site H2 system can be identified as superior to those without the on-site H2 system. The non-dominated cases will mainly happen to those with a 0–9.61 NOCT kW photovoltaic (PV) panel and a 5 kW GSHP but without any solar thermal collector, which have a range of NPVrel between −4115 and 12,556 EUR along with a range of emission between 19.72 and 6.65 kg CO2,eq/m2 a. However, by reducing the electrolyzer cost to the lowest market scenario of 2000 EUR/kW, parts of the cases with the on-site H2 system start to challenge those without the on-site H2 system. Moreover, the change of the emission factor of the H2 fuel from 0.267 to 0.141 kg CO2,eq/kWhLHV will not alter the set of the overall non-dominated cases, but will uniformly reduce the annual emission of these cases by a magnitude of 3.83 kg CO2,eq/m2 a. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

By properly choosing the ionic agent (i.e. H+ or OH−) and the catalyst support, and by tuning the catalyst structure, we developed membrane-electrode-assemblies which are suitable for cost-effective and efficient alcohol electrolysis. Novel porous electrodes were prepared by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) of Pt on a TiO2-Ti web of microfibers and were interfaced to polymeric membranes with either H+ or OH− conductivity. Our results suggest that alcohol electrolysis is more efficient using OH− conducting membranes under appropriate operation conditions (high pH in anolyte solution). ALD enables better catalyst utilization while it appears that the TiO2-Ti substrate is an ideal alternative to the conventional carbon-based diffusion layers, due to its open structure.

	abstract = {Preventing the curtailment of excess renewable generation, caused by mismatches between variable renewable electricity generation and the electric load, is a key strategy for maximizing greenhouse gas emissions reductions by integrating renewable resources into the electric grid. Strategies to harness excess renewable generation for useful purposes exist, but it is unclear which of these end uses provides the most effective use of available excess generation to maximize greenhouse gas emissions reductions in a cost-effective manner. This study investigates and compares three end-use strategies for utilizing excess renewable generation – storage in electrical energy storage systems, production of transportation fuel or vehicle charging, or production of renewable gas – and their diverse technology pathways on the bases of their greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential and the impacts of their implementation on the cost of energy services. This is accomplished by modeling the integration of 46 different technology pathways for using excess renewable generation in a 70% renewable and an 80% renewable electric grid configuration during the year 2050 in California using the Holistic Grid Resource Integration and Deployment (HiGRID) platform, which is a temporally-resolved resource dispatch model of the electricity system. Technology and cost characteristics for batteries, hydrogen energy storage systems, vehicle fueling or charging, and renewable gas production technologies are collected from multiple sources and their effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and affecting the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) services in the HiGRID platform are examined. It was discovered that using excess renewable generation to produce transportation fuel for hydrogen vehicles or to charge electric vehicles provided the largest total greenhouse gas emissions reductions and lowest per-ton cost of greenhouse gas reduction. Use in grid energy storage and production of renewable gas provided similar but relatively lower total greenhouse gas reductions than transportation, with the latter imposing lower per-ton costs of greenhouse gas reduction. More generally, greenhouse gas reduction potential of these end uses depended on the intensity of the fuel being displaced by renewables, while LCOE effects depended on the temporal flexibility of the technologies associated with this end use. Overall, this study provides insight into a priority order for directing the use of excess renewable generation towards end uses to achieve greenhouse gas reduction goals such as those in California in a cost-minimal manner, and investigates the sensitivities that influence the effectiveness of these end uses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

However, the identification of the best solution to obtain a suitable hydrogen in terms of cost, efficiency, availability of energy and material, sharing of renewable energy source, continuity of operation in different locations and plant sizes, poses many challenges in terms of flexibility and complexity of the system. In fact, it involves various chemical equipment, different solar and thermal storage technologies, and variable operative conditions with different reaction temperatures and mixture concentrations. Hence it arises the importance to have a tool for the investigation of this system.

The first level is a minimization programming that minimizes operational cost and CO2 of generators. The CO2 is forwarded to the second level. In the second level, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is designed to capture CO2. The CO2 is combined with Hydrogen and makes Methane (CH4). The required Hydrogen is obtained from water electrolyzer that is supplied by the solar system. The capacity and size of water electrolyzer, solar system, and CCS is designed by the planning in the second level while this programming maximizes profit from selling Methane. As a result, the first level presents minimization programming (i.e., minimizing cost and CO2) and the second level presents maximization programming (i.e., maximizing profit). The programming is developed taking into account solar uncertainty. The stochastic programming is implemented to cope with uncertainties. The problem is formulated as binary mixed integer linear programming and solved by GAMS software. The proposed power to gas (P2G) procedure efficiently designs proper solar system and deals with intermittency of solar energy, reduces CO2 footprint, maximizes profit, and minimizes operational cost of generators at the same time. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Nevertheless, the temporal and spatial gap between the fluctuating production in electrolysis plants and the demand at fueling stations necessitates the construction of infrastructures. Different technologies are available for storing and transporting hydrogen in its gaseous or liquid states, or even via liquid organic hydrogen carriers. To select and compare these different infrastructure options on a nationwide scale in Germany for an energy system 2050, we carried out an infrastructure assessment with spatial resolution to analyze the resulting costs and CO2 emissions, as well as the primary energy demand. To do so, methods for designing a spatially-resolved infrastructure are presented. In particular, the setup of a transmission pipeline with gaseous trailer distribution has not been well represented and investigated in the literature so far. The results show that salt caverns, as well as transmission pipelines, are key technologies for future hydrogen infrastructure systems. The distribution should be handled for low penetration of fuel cell vehicles rates with gaseous compressed trailers and replaced by distribution pipelines in areas with high fueling station densities. This ensures the cost-effective supply during the transition to higher fuel cell vehicle fleets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

With this respect, proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis is one of the most suitable technologies, even though low cost, highly active catalysts and durable electrolyte membranes are still needed. Here we demonstrate the successful use of a nano-composite, sulfated titania (S-TiO2)-added Nafion electrolyte coupled with home-made IrRuOx-based anode and commercial Pt cathode in lab-scale water electrolyzers. Superior electrolysis performances were found at 100 °C when comparing the hybrid electrolyte with undoped Nafion. Indeed, current densities of 4 A cm−2 and 3 A cm−2 were found at a terminal voltage of 2 V for the composite and plain membrane, respectively. Ex-situ conductivity measurements, as well as in-operando impedance spectra, were carried out, demonstrating the beneficial effect of the inorganic filler on membrane properties under practical operating conditions. NMR studies (PFG and relaxation time) corroborate the positive role of the nano-additive on the water retention capacity of the membrane, while the dynamic mechanical analysis shows that the hybrid membrane is stiffer and can resist to temperatures higher than undoped Nafion. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

A building energy management system (BEMS)controlled these system components in an integrated manner. The PEM Ely and FC have fast start-up and high efficiency under partial load operations, indicating suitability for daily start-stop operations. An AB-type TiFe-based alloy (520 kg)is used as the MH (not an AB5-type rare earth alloy that has been commonly used in bench-scale hydrogen store)because, in addition to being low-cost, it is non-hazardous material under Japanese regulations.

	abstract = {While energy demand in this fast developing world is increasing, its future is being compromised by the CO2 emissions produced through the burning of fossil fuels. Clean energy technologies are available, but there are still barriers hindering their full integration into the society, the majority of which are economic and social. For these reasons, the development of new technologies and configurations to make renewable energies systems more cost-effective is urgently needed. The plant design proposed in this paper consists of basic Dish-Stirling collectors supported by a reversible solid oxide fuel cell acting as a power generator and storage unit, and therefore offering dispatchable power on demand. Further, the system reuses the waste heat for seawater desalination, which is very convenient for arid areas with high solar radiation and shortage of freshwater. The present work is an analytical study in which thermodynamic investigation of the performance evaluation of a self-sustainable polygeneration system with integrated hydrogen production, power generation, and freshwater production is conducted. An evaluation in a real context (South Africa) showed the potential of this system to supply 500 kW, 24 h a day, while producing a considerable amount of freshwater. Although the distillation system presented is able to produce 8464 L per day, there is potential for it to increase its output by nine times or more. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this manuscript, the regional focus is Germany; however, the results as well as the methodology can be applied to other regions. Successively, the production costs for the designed system were calculated on the basis of the model results. Various cases for different operational modes and sites have been analyzed. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was made to test the influence of single economic assumptions. Calculations demonstrate that the proposed off-grid systems are a viable option for implementation in a short-term scenario. The results include net production costs of 1.73 €/lGE (GE = gasoline equivalent)for methanol production in the reference case. For optimal wind farm sites, the calculated production costs can drop to 1.32 €/lGE. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the use of renewable energy sources is one of the keys to achieve the sustainable development of societies. The intensive use of fossil fuels has caused effects in the environment and the human health. Greenhouse gas emissions and the carcinogenic effect of diesel are widely demonstrated. The production of clean energy based on renewable sources and the use of hydrogen as an energy vector in general and as an alternative fuel in particular represent a technically feasible reality. However, it is necessary to study the economic variables of centralized or distributed production of hydrogen as an alternative fuel. The aim of this paper is to analyze the technical and economic viability of a centralized generation hydrogen plant for mobility use. It was performed a sensitivity analysis of main parameters such as size of hydrogen production plant, operating hours of the plant, investment costs of the main equipment and electricity price. A NPV of 1,272,692 and a 9-year pay-back were obtained for a centralized hydrogen production plant of 2 MW, considering commercial values of the main evaluation parameters. The sensitivity analysis determines that the main variables affecting the NPV are the price of electricity and the operating hours of the plant. With 95% of confidence, the NPV will be positive with an 80.19% of certainty. Therefore, centralized hydrogen production represents a technically viable, environmentally friendly and economically attractive process that can rapidly position hydrogen as an alternative fuel for mobility. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Power-to-Gas (PtG) represents a promising option to foster the conversion of renewable electricity into energy carriers that may attend electrical, thermal, or mechanical needs on-demand. This work aimed to incorporate a stochastic approach (Artificial Neural Network combined with Monte Carlo simulations) into the thermodynamic and economic analysis of the PtG process hybridized with an oxy-fuel boiler (modelled in Aspen Plus®). Such approach generated probability density curves for the key techno-economic performance indicators of the PtG process. Results showed that the mean utilisation of electricity from RES, accounting for the chemical energy in SNG and heat from methanators, reached 62.6%. Besides, the probability that the discounted cash flow is positive was estimated to be only 13.4%, under the set of conditions considered in the work. This work also showed that in order to make the mean net present value positive, subsidies of 68 €/MWelh are required (with respect to the electricity consumed by PtG process from RES).

Hydrogen energy is considered a promising renewable energy to replace fossil fuels because it is a sustainable, clean, and green energy source. Among hydrogen production methods, water splitting has the highest reliability and is used the most often. Platinum is normally used as water splitting catalyst and an electrode. However, there has been much effort to replace it as such owing to its high cost. Copper (Cu) is not used as water splitting catalyst or an electrode, despite its high current density, because of its corrosive properties. In this study, carbon was coated onto a Cu substrate and a hydrogen production experiment was carried out with 0.1 M Na2SO4 and 0.1 M H2SO4 electrolytes. As a result, the carbon coating decreased oxidation rate of the Cu electrode and effected stability in short-term hydrogen evolution experiment. This indicates the possibility of carbon-Cu electrode with other catalytic materials. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

A multi-period optimization model was developed to design a hydrogen fuel supply chain based on a mixed integer linear programming formulation. The model was applied to the light duty passenger vehicle sector in British Columbia under three hydrogen demand scenarios. As part of the objective function, the model incorporated the current provincial emissions mitigation policies, i.e., a carbon tax and a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS). Based on cost, our model indicates that steam methane reforming (SMR) is the least costly hydrogen production technology even with carbon policies in place. However, SMR would result in higher emissions (compared to other pathways). Coupling the carbon tax with the LCFS can be a suitable policy option when hydrogen price and GHG emissions are weighted equally. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The configuration is based on a methanation process, directly applied on flue gas stream thus acting both as a CO2 capture and sequestration technology and as renewable energy storage mechanism. Reacting hydrogen is produced via water electrolysis powered by surplus of renewable energy, normally low-priced otherwise wasted. With a reference capacity factor around 4000 h/y, the resulting SNG cost is 0.34 €/Nm3 based on a carbon tax equal to 30 €/t CO2.

	abstract = {The use of hydrogen to store electricity is no longer utopian nor merely theoretical. Hydrogen applications such as Power-to-Gas systems are entering the market and some of them are ready to compete with other options in the near future. This means they have indeed a potential for profitability, especially if seen as large-scale storage solutions for the electricity surplus produced by variable renewable energy sources. In this study Power-to-Industry, Power-to-Mobility and Power-to-Power applications are chosen to be investigated and compared through levelized cost of hydrogen to identify the main cost drivers and consequently understand the possible solutions to reduce costs. The feasibility of the applications is discussed and analyzed in Germany, Belgium and Iceland, with mid and long-term perspectives, focusing the analysis on the advantage of scaling up. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {                             For the sustainable clean and green energy, hydrogen is considered as one of the prominent renewable energy source which attracted increasing interests in recent years. To produce this, one of the cheapest method is water electrolysis. But several challenges in water electrolysis are, to reduce the maintenance cost, energy consumption and high cost of platinum electrode material. So, in search of an alternative low cost and efficient electrode material, researchers are modifying various metals electrodes to replace the noble metal electrodes. Stainless steel (SS 304) is one of the types of carbon steel material commonly used for various applications. The aim of the work is to explore the stainless steel (SS 304), annealed at high temperature, with and without “hydrogen and argon” environment and tested the samples for hydrogen production in sea water condition (3.5% NaCl).

From Raman, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical measurements it was observed that, the sample prepared under hydrogen and argon environment is stable when compared with the rest of the samples. Decrease in relative amount of chromium oxide was observed for the sample annealed in air environment. The rate of production of hydrogen prepared under “hydrogen and argon” environment is higher and the results are discussed.                          © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In the transition from fossil to renewable energy, the energy system should become clean, while remaining reliable and affordable. Because of the intermittent nature of both renewable energy production and energy demand, an integrated system approach is required that includes energy conversion and storage. We propose a concept for a neighbourhood where locally produced renewable energy is partly converted and stored in the form of heat and hydrogen, accompanied by rainwater collection, storage, purification and use (Power-to-H3). A model is developed to create an energy balance and perform a techno-economic analysis, including an analysis of the avoided costs within the concept. The results show that a solar park of 8.7 MWp combined with rainwater collection and solar panels on roofs, can supply 900 houses over the year with heat (20 TJ) via an underground heat storage system as well as with almost half of their water demand (36,000 m3) and 540 hydrogen electric vehicles can be supplied with hydrogen (90 tonnes). The production costs for both hydrogen (8.7 €/kg) and heat (26 €/GJ) are below the current end user selling price in the Netherlands (10 €/kg and 34 €/GJ), making the system affordable. When taking avoided costs into account, the prices could decrease with 20–26%, while at the same time avoiding 3600 tonnes of CO2 a year. These results make clear that it is possible to provide a neighbourhood with all these different utilities, completely based on solar power and rainwater in a reliable, affordable and clean way. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {For this study, a spatially and temporally resolved optimization model was used to investigate and economically evaluate pathways for using surplus electricity to cover positive residual loads by means of different technologies to reconvert hydrogen into electricity. The associated technology pathways consist of electrolyzers, salt caverns, hydrogen pipelines, power cables, and various technologies for reconversion into electricity. The investigations were conducted based on an energy scenario for 2050 in which surplus electricity from northern Germany is available to cover the electricity grid load in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). A key finding of the pathway analysis is that NRW's electricity demand can be covered entirely by renewable energy sources in this scenario, which involves CO2 savings of 44.4 million tons of CO2/a in comparison to the positive residual load being covered from a conventional power plant fleet. The pathway involving CCGT (combined cycle gas turbines) as hydrogen reconversion option was identified as being the most cost effective (total investment: € 43.1 billion, electricity generation costs of reconversion: € 176/MWh). Large-scale hydrogen storage and reconversion as well as the use of the hydrogen infrastructure built for this purpose can make a meaningful contribution to the expansion of the electricity grid. However, for reasons of efficiency, substituting the electricity grid expansion entirely with hydrogen reconversion systems does not make sense from an economic standpoint. Furthermore, the hydrogen reconversion pathways evaluated, including large-scale storage, significantly contribute to the security of the energy supply and to secured power generation capacities. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Long-term planning for replacement of fossil fuel energy technologies with renewables is of great importance for achieving GHG emission reduction targets. The current study is focused on developing a five-year mathematical model for finding the optimal sizing of renewable energy technologies for achieving certain CO2 emission reduction targets. A manufacturing industrial facility which uses CHP for electricity generation and natural gas for heating is considered as the base case in this work. Different renewable energy technologies are developed each year to achieve a 4.53% annual CO2 emission reduction target. The results of this study show that wind power is the most cost-effective technology for reducing emissions in the first and second year with a cost of 44 and 69 CAD per tonne of CO2, respectively. Hydrogen, on the other hand, is more cost-effective than wind power in reducing CO2 emissions from the third year on. The cost of CO2 emission reduction with hydrogen doesn't change drastically from the first year to the fifth year (107 and 130 CAD per tonne of CO2). Solar power is a more expensive technology than wind power for reducing CO2 emissions in all years due to lower capacity factor (in Ontario), more intermittency (requiring mores storage capacity), and higher investment cost. A hybrid wind/battery/hydrogen energy system has the lowest emission reduction cost over five years. The emission reduction cost of such hybrid system increases from 44 CAD per tonne of CO2 in the first year to 156 CAD per tonne of CO2 in the fifth year. The developed model can be used for long-term planning of energy systems for achieving GHG emission targets in a regions/country which has fossil fuel-based electricity and heat generation infrastructure. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {With the growing adoption of intermittent renewable energy generation the role for energy storage to provide a number of service needs is being increasingly recognised. However, ‘energy storage’ encompasses a family of technologies, each with its own set of performance, cost and physical characteristics, at different stages of development. At the same time, each energy system – however defined – has specific needs; and energy systems are themselves part of a wider socio-technical system which has aims beyond the confines of the energy ‘trilemma’. As energy storage technologies develop, funding is becoming available to demonstrate their application in realistic environments. However, with multiple technical and non-technical factors to consider, it is challenging for many decision makers who often have limited expertise and resources to select which projects to support. In this paper we first describe a novel framework for assessing the wider benefits that could come from deploying energy storage using Multi-Attribute Value Theory (MAVT), a form of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis. We then use the framework to assess six potential energy storage projects through a combination of technical analysis and stakeholder input in the county of Cornwall in the UK: a region that has good solar and wind resource with relatively low demand and constrained network infrastructure. The projects assessed were: power to gas, a distributed battery system, battery storage integrated with solar PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay, liquid air energy storage, battery storage integrated with wave energy, and thermal energy storage at a new residential development. We conclude that MAVT can provide a straightforward and user-friendly approach, which can be easily used by decision makers for assessing energy storage projects across a range of criteria and promoting engagement with stakeholders. This approach also allows the subjectivity of decision-making, a potential limitation, to be explored through a sensitivity analysis. The use of MAVT can lead to important insights for the development of energy systems, which in this study included the importance of local priorities to decision-making. In this case, battery storage with PV and demand from Cornwall Airport Newquay was the top-ranking project, performing well across a range of attributes including the maturity of the technology, its ability to defer grid upgrades and economic viability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper deals with hydrogen production via water electrolysis, which is considered the most attractive and promising solution. Specifically, the use of renewable energy sources, such as wind electric power generators, is hypothesized for supplying the electrolyzer, aiming to strongly reduce the environmental impact. In particular, micro-wind energy conversion systems (μWECSs) are attractive for their low cost and easy installation. In order to interface the μWECS and the electrolyzer, suitable power conditioning systems such as step-down DC-DC converters are mandatory. However, due to the requested high conversion ratio between the DC bus grid, i.e. the output of a three-phase diode rectifier connected to the output of the electric generator, and the rated supply voltage of the electrolyzer, the classic buck converter alone is not suitable. Therefore, a converter is proposed and designed, consisting of a buck converter, a full-bridge IGBT converter, a single-phase transformer, and a diode bridge rectifier; LC filters are also included between buck and full-bridge converters, and at the output of the diode bridge rectifier with the aim of reducing the ripple on currents and voltages. The components of the described physical system from the output of the three-phase rectifier up to the electrolyzer are then modeled assuming the transformer as ideal, and the model is employed for designing a PI-type controller. Experimental results are provided in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed converter and its control for these applications. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Therefore, it is expected that the share of renewable energy will further increase. Due to the introduction of these intermittent energy sources, the need for flexibility in our energy system increases significantly. Power-to-gas (P2G) is one promising option for providing long term energy storage and for providing flexibility to the electricity system. An interesting, recent technological development is biological methanation. The latter utilizes microorganisms to catalyze the Sabatier reaction. This biological reaction can be achieved at lower temperatures and pressures than when a chemical catalyst is used and has a higher tolerance to contaminations from the CO2 source, process upset or contamination by foreign organisms. We investigate the techno-economic potential of biological methanation (i.e. microbial power-to-gas concept) using a case study that revolves around anaerobic digestion using mainly municipal organic waste in Belgium. The most important parameters that influence the economic feasibility are the electricity consumption (44%), operating hours of the electrolyser (14%), and the investment cost of the electrolyser (14%). Based on our findings we offer further routes of research that serve to strengthen the business case. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The advantages of this research are twofold, (i) on the one hand, it provides the methodology for the optimal use of surplus hydrogen gases promoting the shift to a Circular Economy and, (ii) on the other hand, it contributes to the penetration of renewable energies in the form of low cost fuel cell devices to power stationary and mobile applications. The results show that the combination of all the infrastructure elements into the mathematical formulation yields optimal solutions with a plan for the gradual infrastructure investments over time required for the transition towards a sustainable future energy mix that includes hydrogen. Thus, this work contributes to improving the environmental and economic sustainability of hydrogen supply chains of upcycling industrial surplus hydrogen. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper analyzes the drivers promoting hydrogen-based renewable energy utilization, focusing on a group of 32 countries by applying panel data techniques. The pooled ordinary least square estimator and fixed effect estimator are employed for comparison. Grey relational analysis is used to explore the relationships at a national level between renewable energy development and its influencing factors. The main results over our time span indicate that: (1) GDP per capita is a significantly positive contributor to renewable energy consumption, while oil price does not present a strong relationship in the use of renewables; (2) social awareness about climate change and concerns for energy security is not enough to motivate the switch from traditional to renewable energy sources; (3) the role of urbanization in renewable energy consumption relies on different stages of the urbanization process, resulting in opposite trends in renewable energy development between developing and developed countries. The results show that the market mechanism is not entirely responsible for encouraging the use of renewables and the role of climate change and energy security concerns in renewables use should be enhanced. By analyzing the results, policy implications are provided for the sustainable development of renewable energy. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper presents an energy management and reserve scheduling scheme in order to optimally operate a 17-bus Low Voltage (LV) grid-tied microgrid, powered by photovoltaics, a wind turbine and a Fuel Cell (FC) utilizing on site hydrogen production and storage. Since high Renewable Energy Resources (RES) penetration is assumed, the expected deviations due to their intermittency are accounted for by the reserve provision by the FC system, in order to deviate as little as possible from the scheduled energy demand injected by the upstream grid. All these are incorporated into the operating cost of the microgrid assuming penalization of unscheduled power injections from the grid. The intermittency of RES and load are incorporated in the model by assuming known probability density functions for the forecasting errors. Then, energy and reserve scheduling is performed utilizing the Harmony Search algorithm in order to minimize the expected operating costs of the examined system by optimal reserve and energy provision from the stored/generated hydrogen. For that purpose, hourly optimizations are performed for a given year to assess the value on-site hydrogen generation and FC technologies add to microgrid operation and Distributed Generation (DG) in general. The purpose is to prove the use of hydrogen storage systems in effective uncertainty balancing. The hydrogen storage system appears to effectively counter the intermittency of renewables in moderate penetration, reducing the uncertainty costs. In higher renewable penetrations, due to uncertainty being already accounted for by the storage, the benefits of the RES penetration are even greater. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In this paper, optimal size and power exchange of a grid-connected diesel generator-photovoltaic-fuel cell (diesel/PV/FC) hybrid energy system is investigated by multi-objective optimization for a community in Kerman, Iran. To optimally size hybrid system, number of system components (PV panels, diesel generators, electrolysers, FCs and hydrogen tanks) are considered as decision variables. In this paper, to optimize power exchange between the hybrid system and grid, two other decision variables are introduced: selling coefficient and purchase coefficient. Selling and purchase coefficients are defined to optimize the amount of electricity sold to the grid and the amount of electricity purchased from the grid, respectively. In order to optimally design the hybrid system, multi-objective optimization has been considered with respect to three objectives: levelized cost of energy (LCOE), loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and renewability. Based on simulation results, it can be drawn that when the hybrid system can sell/buy energy to/from the grid, (1) by decreasing non-renewable energy source usage, the value of LPSP increases, (2) by decrease of non-renewable energy usage, value of LCOE increases and (3) using FC system leads to increasing LCOE. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

It can answer variants of the following questions What is the most effective way, in terms of cost, value/profit and/or emissions, of designing and operating the integrated multi-vector energy networks that utilise a variety of primary energy sources to deliver different energy services, such as heat, electricity and mobility, given the availability of primary resources and the levels of demands and their distribution across space and time? When to invest in technologies, where to locate them; what resources should be used, where, when and how to convert them to the energy services required; how to transport the resources and manage inventory?Scenarios for Great Britain were examined involving different primary energy sources, such as natural gas, biomass and wind power, in order to satisfy demands for heat, electricity and mobility via various energy vectors such as electricity, natural gas, hydrogen and syngas. Different objectives were considered, such as minimising cost, maximising profit, minimising emissions and maximising renewable energy production, subject to the availability of suitable land for biomass and wind turbines as well as the maximum local production and import rates for natural gas. Results suggest that if significant mobility demands are met by hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, then hydrogen is the preferred energy vector, over natural gas, for satisfying heat demands. If natural gas is not used and energy can only be generated from wind power and biomass, electricity and syngas are the preferred energy carriers for satisfying electricity and heat demands. © 2017 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This work presents an integrative approach to environmental and cost assessment of current and future motorcycle technologies for four motorcycle size categories, three powertrain types, and a variety of fuel supply chains. We consider conventional gasoline (ICEV), battery electric (BEV) and fuel cell electric (FCEV) motorcycles with production years from 1990 to 2030. Motorcycle energy consumption is modelled based on the world harmonized motorcycle test cycle and calibrated with data measured from existing motorcycles. We model the potential future performance of motorcycles by adapting the model input parameters according to historic trends and future component performance predictions. We find that smaller motorcycles have much better environmental performance than larger motorcycles, though this is mostly due to the fact that larger motorcycles have different driving patterns: urban driving is found to have much lower environmental impact per kilometer than highway driving. Current BEV are found to have similar ownership costs to ICEV. They also have reduced climate change potential by roughly 60% when they are powered by electricity from natural gas, 80% when powered by renewables, and they still offer advantages over conventional motorcycles when charged with electricity from hard coal. Next generation BEV are found to have similar environmental performance advantages, though with a definite cost advantage. FCEV climate change reduction potential is found to depend strongly on the source of the hydrogen fuel, with climate benefits being substantial with hydrogen originating from renewable energy sources. Future cost competitiveness of FCEVs is linked closely to the development of fuel cell costs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

For this reason, governments are promoting energy efficiency programmes, carbon capture technologies, and renewable energies as a way to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change. Hydrogen is a clean alternative to fossil fuels in automotive applications. In this context, the objective of this project is to find the best design of a hydrogen refuelling station in terms of the number of banks and their size, having as a final aim the most cost-efficient design. This study suggests that, from an economic point of view, a state of charge for the vehicle of 100% is not adequate, since it requires very large high-pressure banks at the station, which increases significantly its setup costs. The study finds that high-pressure banks have to be bigger in volume than the low-pressure banks to minimise the total cost of the station, including setup and operational costs along its timespan. Finally, the project shows that the optimal number of banks is 4 or a maximum of 5. As a side conclusion, these results have practical implications for firms, as they might reduce the time spent in the design process of a hydrogen refuelling station. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In order to study cost-optimal and reliable zero and negative carbon power systems, a power system model of Western Europe for 2050 is developed. Realistic future technology costs, demand levels and generator flexibility constraints are considered. The optimised portfolios are tested for both favourable and unfavourable future weather conditions using results from a global climate model, accounting for the potential impacts of climate change on Europe's weather. The cost optimal mix for zero or negative carbon power systems consists of firm low-carbon capacity, intermittent renewable energy sources and flexibility capacity. In most scenarios, the amount of low-carbon firm capacity is around 75% of peak load, providing roughly 65% of the electricity demand. Furthermore, it is found that with a high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, a high dependence on cross border transmission, batteries and a shift to new types of ancillary services is required to maintain a reliable power system. Despite relatively small changes in the total generation from intermittent renewable energy sources between favourable and unfavourable weather years of 6%, emissions differ up to 70 MtCO2 yr−1 and variable systems costs up to 25%. In a highly interconnected power system with significant flexible capacity in the portfolio and minimal curtailment of intermittent renewables, the potential role of green hydrogen as a means of electricity storage appears to be limited. © 2019 The Authors},

Nowadays, no-noble materials are usually employed as low-cost catalysts to overcome the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, kinetics and mechanistic studies of the HER from faradaic currents is becoming more challenging due to the overlap of by-side reactions such as catalyst oxides reduction. Herein, for the first time ionic currents from differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS)are employed to overcome this issue.

In particular, the effect of gas composition was deeply investigated. A mapping of performances was realized through polarization curves. Dilution of reactants, both in SOFC and SOE brings to reduction in performances while different compositions during SOE-SOFC transition did not give any significant effect to stack voltages.

	abstract = {In the context of increasing use of renewable energy sources, residential energy supply systems are changing as well. In this paper, a techno-economical model for the energy supply of a district including both electrical and thermal demand as well as renewable energy generation is developed. Furthermore, a high penetration of fuel cell electric vehicles is assumed and the hydrogen has to be provided by the energy supply system as well. The single components of the energy system are optimal sized, with respect to the total cost of ownership of the system, while the systems operation strategy is defined by a fixed ranking list. A reference case is defined by actual or near future techno-economical assumptions of the components. In the resulting optimal system, the most important components are a large PV system, a SOFC for heat and power generation and a PEM electrolyzer for hydrogen production. The produced hydrogen is used solely to refuel the fuel cell electric vehicles. On this basis, the influences of the components investment costs and the energy purchasing costs on the system configuration are investigated. It is shown that, the PV investment costs as well as the feed-in tariff can cause qualitative differences in the system configuration. Moreover, interactions between all conversion devices with respect to the optimal sizing are identified. Finally, it is shown that if the PV investment costs and the feed-in tariff decreases in the future, a reconversion of the self produced hydrogen in the SOFC becomes economically feasible, even for small natural gas purchasing costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The battery-assist will result in a lower hydrogen production cost when the benefit associated with the smaller capacity and higher operation ratio of the electrolyzer exceeds the necessary investment for battery installation. The results from this study indicated the cost of hydrogen as low as 17 to 27 JPY/Nm3 using a combination of technologies and the achievement of ambitious individual cost targets for batteries, PV, and electrolyzers. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

We show that such a condition, not deeply investigated in previous literature, turns out to be crucial for the long term stability of the electrodes under constant current stress. The amount of Pt on the Ni foam has been experimentally evaluated, obtaining optimal results with 0.015 mg cm−2 of noble metal in a 0.16 cm thick electrode.

	abstract = {This article presents results of research into hydrogen generators and fuel cells (basic elements in Power-to-Gas-to-Power systems) together with an economic analysis of this installation type. A hydrogen generator containing two AEM (Anion Exchange Membrane) alkaline electrolyzers with a performance of 0.5 Nm3 H2/h and a PEM fuel cell with an electrical power of 0.72 kW were tested. A methodology is presented for determining gross and net efficiency characteristics of the tested devices using measurement results. These operations allowed assessment of the efficiency characteristics as a function of electrical power and identification of the power needs of a hydrogen generator and a fuel cell system. This is important because in P2G2P installations integrated with renewable energy sources these devices operate with variable loads. For a nominal power value, the efficiency of the hydrogen generator was 63% and the efficiency of the fuel cell system was about 40%. For an energy storage system in hydrogen form, a simplified methodology for determining the price ratio of the electric energy sales to the purchase price of the electricity was determined, in order to discover whether the system could be economically efficient. This allowed the determination of the components of this relationship related to the efficiency of the installation and the investment costs of each element. Economic analyses assumed the installation operated with nominal power for a certain period of time throughout the day, strictly connected to the valley and peak of electricity demand. Analysis results are presented as a function of P2G2P system efficiency and working time of hydrogen generators and fuel cells during twenty-four hours. Studies and analyses were performed for P2G2P installations with the most commonly considered elements in energy storage systems. These are considered a very promising solution to the energy balance process, for connecting a high amount of power from renewable energy sources to the power grid. © 2018},

The HPS comprises Wind Turbines (WTs) and Photovoltaic (PV) panels such as primary Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) in addition to both Fuel Cells (FCs) and Gas Micro–Turbines (GMTs) which are used as Backup Sources (BKUSs).To avoid the undesired negative impacts on the HPS functionality because of the RESs intermittency, the Hydrogen Storage System (HSS) is integrated into the system. Two different energy management strategies based on Neural Networks (NN) and Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) respectively are applied to the HPS for minimizing the energy production cost and keeping the buffer role of HSS. Using MATLAB™, the proposed two AI introduced solutions are used for reaching adequate energy management operation performance for the overall HPS during 24 h load variation. From the numerical simulations, the superiority of the FLC over the NN control approach is discussed. The proposed HSS can positively act as a buffer solution to avoid drawbacks of RESs during unexpected load peaks and/or discontinuous energy production. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this paper a perturbation of system design is studied with validated models to understand the variability of performance over a full year operation. Moreover, a multi-objective optimal sizing methodology is proposed in terms of the minimization of a functional parameter taking into account costs, RES (Renewable Energy Sources) exploitation and pollutant emission factors. The influence of different weather conditions on the HRES (Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems) performance is analyzed investigating the system behavior for three different locations in Europe. The analysis of three real case studies showed that 20% ratio of the energy produced by fossil fuels over the energy produced by renewables sources can be obtained slightly increasing the PV (PhotoVoltaic) plant size with minor effects on the RES exploitation. Moreover, a lower LCOE (Levelized Cost Of Energy) can be achieved increasing the PV size and reducing battery size with an unavoidable reduction of the RES exploitation. Results for different sites highlighted the obtainment of different optimal sizings for each site. However, similar performance parameters can be obtained in the different case studies for Tilos, Rome and Brighton with an average LCOE of 0.5 €/kWh and a variability in the order of 0.1 €/kWh. © 2019},

	abstract = {An efficient, reliable and cost-effective energy storage is necessary to increase the use of renewables and to contribute in reducing the carbon footprint of the electricity grid. A novel iron-air battery characterized by high performance, safety and reliability for operation at intermediate temperatures (500–650 °C) is demonstrated. The iron-air rechargeable battery is based on a new configuration where both the nickel-electrode and the hydrogen/water redox processes, generally utilized in high temperature ceramic batteries, are avoided in this system completely operating in the solid state. This can increase the durability and reliability of the battery while providing excellent performance (specific energy of 0.46 Wh g−1, specific capacity of 0.5 Ah g−1, faradaic efficiency 80%). These characteristics favourably compare to low temperature iron-air batteries. Excellent performance and cyclability are achieved at 650 °C for the iron-air solid-state battery showing no relevant degradation after more than 100 cycles. The concept is based on a composite iron-ceria anode in contact with an oxygen anion-conducting lanthanum gallate electrolyte and a mixed conductivity lanthanum ferrite perovskite-based cathode. This combines both simplicity of operation and intrinsic safety with high energy density and durability. The excellent dynamic behaviour, the absence of influence of external environmental conditions and the use of cost-effective ceramic materials, with the possibility to produce high quality heat to cover the chain of electrical and thermal energy, make such systems largely appealing for applications related to renewable power sources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In regard to energy portfolio, we need to make it in line with these under smart energy solutions. With the developed cutting-edge technologies and artificial intelligence applications, we need to change the course of action in dealing with energy matters by covering the entire energy spectrum under five categories, namely, energy fundamentals and concepts, energy materials, energy production, energy conversion, and energy management. It is important to highlight the importance of a recent event. On 17 January 2017 a total of thirteen leading energy, transport and industry companies in the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) have launched a global initiative, so-called: Hydrogen Council, to voice a united vision and long-term ambition for hydrogen to foster the energy transition. It has aimed to join the global efforts in promoting hydrogen to help meet climate goals. This is a clear indication that smart solutions are not possible without hydrogen options. This study focuses on introducing and highlighting smart energy solutions under the portfolio pertaining to exergization, greenization, renewabilization, hydrogenization, integration, multigeneration, storagization, and intelligization. Each one of these plays a critical role within the smart energy portfolio and becomes key for a more sustainable future. This study also focuses on the newly developed smart energy systems by combining both renewable energy sources and hydrogen energy systems to provide more efficient, more cost-effective, more environmentally benign and more sustainable solutions for implementation. Furthermore, a wide range of integrated systems is presented to illustrate the feasibility and importance such a coupling to overcome several technical issues.

	abstract = {Hydrogen energy can be effectively converted from various energy sources, such as renewable energy or hydrocarbon fuel, and therefore, it is a promising energy source. Various hydrogen production processes have been proposed worldwide because conventional energy conversion systems, after minor design modifications, can be used for such conversions. However, hydrogen gas can be more dangerous than other flammable gases if released into the atmosphere, where it can rapidly reach its explosion limit because of its high diffusion velocity. Therefore, a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) for hydrogen production processes is required. In this study, FMEA is performed for hydrogen produced from coal syngas using Thermococcus onnurineus NA1, which was discovered in the Indonesian deep sea. A fuzzy inference methodology is introduced for a quantitative analysis of the linguistic ambiguity of risk priority number estimated from a conventional FMEA. To estimate the objective severity ranking, we introduced the potential asset loss combined with the proportionate cost of each piece of equipment under total capital investment and a weight value influenced by environmental and mankind. Moreover, we proposed a fuzzified risk matrix to effectively represent the fuzzy risk priority number (f-RPN) under the risk matrix; variation with and without fuzzification of risk priority number is then expressed to ascertain why this variation has occurred through a vector diagram. Based on the f-RPN vector diagram, we have performed a design revision of the hydrogen production process using Thermococcus onnurineus NA1 to adjust the risk priority number downward from a broadly unacceptable region. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The nickel-cobalt composite catalyst and modified activated carbon anode was evaluated in one-chamber DGAFC. Our results demonstrated that the DGAFC performance was greatly improved with the addition of Ni-Co composite catalyst in the anode. Fuel cell achieved the peak power density of 23.97 W m−2 under the condition of 1 M glucose, 3 M KOH and ambient temperature. The enhancement of the anode performance could be attributed to the synergic effect of two reversible redox systems, Ni(II)/Ni(III) and Co(II)/Co(III), which improved interfacial charge-transfer kinetics.

	abstract = {The need for flexible power plants could increase in the future as variable renewable energy (VRE) share will increase in the power grid. These power plants could balance the increasing strain on electricity grids by renewables. The proposed plant in this paper can adapt to these ramps in electricity demand of the power grid by maintaining a constant feed and producing also high purity hydrogen. Dry methane reforming (DMR) is incorporated into a flexible power plant model and the key performance indicators are calculated from a techno-economic perspective. The net output of the plant is 450 MW with the possibility to lower power production and produce hydrogen, maintaining a high CO2 capture rate (72%). Two cases are compared to the base case to quantify: (i) energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture and (ii) advantages of flexible power plant operation. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the base case is 67 Euro/MWh, the addition of a carbon capture unit increases it to 82 Euro/MWh. In the case of flexible operation, both the LCOE and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) are calculated and the two depend on the cost allocation factor. The LCOE ranges from 65 to 85 Euro/MWh while the LCOH from 0.15 to 0.073 Euro/Nm3. The DMR power plant presented in Cases 1 and 2 present little advantages in today's market conditions however, the flexible plant (Case 3) can be viable option in balancing VRE. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The high share of fluctuating renewable energy sources (FRES) such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) necessitates the need for controllable generation, storage devices or adjustable consumption, due to the surplus arising from installed capacity that exceeds the conventional electrical load. The use of this surplus to produce hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis is called “Power-to-Gas” (P2G). This study investigates the potential use of electrolyzers in the electrical distribution grid as an alternative to a network expansion with cables. For this purpose, an existing distribution grid was modelled and the possible size of an electrolyzer investigated so as to achieve the same effect as with an electrical cable in terms of, for example, the voltage level. The investment cost of both possibilities was compared and the hydrogen production costs analyzed. The results show that laying a cable is currently a more cost-effective option in comparison to an electrolyzer, costing around 30% of the overall investment required for the electrolyzer. The remaining 70% of the electrolyzer cost needs to be met by other means, for example by selling the hydrogen produced. However, profitability is highly dependent on the surplus in the grid and thus the full load hours of the electrolyzer. Furthermore, the results obtained cannot be generalized, since they are highly influenced by the scenario used. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {When transitioning to a 100% renewable energy system storing electricity becomes a focal point, as the resource flexibility is lost and the design of the energy system needs to provide flexibility and balancing options to integrate intermittent renewable resources. Using technologies such as power-to-gas offers an opportunity to store electricity in chemical form, which can be used as a long-term storage option. This paper develops a spatial modelling method by using a GIS tool to investigate potential generation sites for power-to-gas plants. The method determines the location of the plants by carbon source potential, proximity of the grid, costs of grid transmission and investment costs of the technology itself. By combining these types of data, it is possible to identify the investment costs of the power-to-gas plants. The method focuses on two paths: biogas upgrade and CO2 methanation. The method is applied to a specific case by investigating the power-to-gas potential in Denmark. The potential and spatial deployment is found by examining the investment costs of plants with an annual gas production of 60 GWh. The findings of the analysis indicate that the biogas upgrade path is the cheapest one of the two, at the present cost level, but due to the relatively small number of biogas plants in Denmark, the chosen plant size is limited to around 55 plants. CO2 methanation is a more costly path, but it has a larger potential of around 800 plants. As the analysis is based on the current sources for biogas and CO2, it is important to emphasise that the potential for CO2 methanation plants can be expected to diminish in the future as more renewable energy is introduced, lowering the need for thermal energy producers, while biogas production could see an increase. Nevertheless, the analysis of a specific case shows that the method gives a good indication of the extent of the power-to-gas resources by using a novel approach to the matter. The method can be applied in other countries as well, giving it a wide appeal. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In the spectrum of current energy possibilities, hydrogen represents a solution of great interest toward a future sustainable energy system. No single technology can sustain the energy needs of the whole society, but integration and hybridization are two key strategic features for viable energy production based in hydrogen economy. In the present work, a hydrogen energy model is analyzed. In this model hydrogen is produced through the electrolysis of water, taking advantage of the electrical energy produced by a renewable generator (photovoltaic panels). The produced hydrogen is chemically stored by the synthesis of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). NaBH4 promising features in terms of safety and high volumetric density are exploited for transportation to a remote site where hydrogen is released from NaBH4 hydrolysis and used for energy production. This model is compared from an economic standpoint with the traditional hydrogen storage and transportation technology (compressed hydrogen in tanks). This paper presents a thermodynamic and economic analysis of the process in order to determine its economic feasibility. Data employed for the realization of the model have been gathered from recent important progresses made on the subject. The innovative plant including NaBH4 synthesis and transportation is compared from an economic standpoint with the traditional hydrogen storage and transportation technology (compressed hydrogen in tanks). As a final point, the best technology and the components’ optimal sizes are evaluated for both cases in order to minimize production costs. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The integrating of hydrogen application into the energy system will change the current energy market. Therefore, this paper deploys the life cycle cost analysis of hydrogen production by polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis and applications for electricity and mobility purposes. The hydrogen production process includes electricity generated from wind turbines, PEM electrolyser, hydrogen compression, storage, and distribution by H2 truck and tube trailer. The hydrogen application process includes PEM fuel cell stacks generating electricity, a H2 refuelling station supplying hydrogen, and range extender fuel cell electric vehicles (RE-FCEVs). The cost analysis is conducted from a demonstration project of green hydrogen on a remote archipelago. The methodology of life cycle cost is employed to conduct the cost of hydrogen production and application. Five scenarios are developed to compare the cost of hydrogen applications with the conventional energy sources considering CO2 emission cost. The comparisons show the cost of using hydrogen for energy purposes is still higher than the cost of using fossil fuels. The largest contributor of the cost is the electricity consumption. In the sensitivity analysis, policy supports such as feed-in tariff (FITs) could bring completive of hydrogen with fossil fuels in current energy market. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In order to alleviate the contradictions of increasingly prominent environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and oil resource security issues, the search for renewable and clean alternative energy sources is getting more and more attention. Hydrogen energy is known as a future energy source because of its safety, reliability, wide range of resources and non-polluting products. Hydrogen internal combustion engine combines the technical advantages of traditional internal combustion engines and has comprehensive comparative advantages in terms of manufacturing cost, fuel adaptability and reliability. It is one of the practical ways to realize hydrogen energy utilization. In this paper, the combustion characteristics and NOx emission of a turbocharged hydrogen engine were investigated using the test data. The results showed the combustion duration (the crank angle of 10%–90% fuel burned) at 1500 rpm and 2000 rpm was equal and the combustion duration is much bigger than the other loads when the BMEP is 0.27 MPa. The reason is the effect of the turbocharger on the gas exchange process, which will influence the combustion process. The cylinder pressure and pressure rise rate were also investigated and the peak pressure rise rate was lower than 0.25 MPa/°CA at all working conditions. Moreover, the NOx emission changed from 300 ppm to 1200 ppm with engine speed increasing and the maximum value can reach to 7000 ppm when the equivalence ratio is 0.88 at 2500 rpm, maximum brake torque. The NOx emission shows different changing tendencies with different working conditions. Finally, these conclusions can be used to develop controlling strategies to solve the contradictions among power, brake thermal efficiency and NOx emission for the turbocharged hydrogen internal combustion engines. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

At the same time, the equipment is clean, continuous operating, long-lasting and maximally reliable, with no polluting or greenhouse emissions. The components of the Power Plant are developed for the unified DC voltage with an option of adding more on the DC bus bar, scaling the power of the Plant up. It presents a flexibility and modularity in combination with the scalable Hydrogen Storage capacity suitable for different demands of distributed energy consumers including both residential and small business. The comprehensive analysis of the renewable energy sources and in particular wind turbines included the study of the main known types and classes. As a result, the choice was made in favor of proprietary design of innovative multi-tier scalable Vertical Axis Wind Turbine as a main power source, the uninterrupted supply part of which is based on the looped cycle Hydrogen Module containing Electrolyser Module, Fuel Cells Assembly System and Hydrogen Storage with communication and control equipment. The intelligent control algorithms optimize the operation of the Plant minimizing the start-stop cycling phases, stretching the servicing periods and extending the lifetime of the equipment. Remote control provides monitoring and managing all processes of power generation and hydrogen storage via Internet anytime, almost anywhere. The project has proved the presented equipment as long-live, reliable and environmentally friendly, as well as modular and flexible, easily scaled under consumer's control, covering the big power consumption range from personal to small business scale.

Hydrogen fuel produced by renewable sources such as the solar and wind energy can be an alternative fuel to depress the use of fuels based on fossil sources in the transport sector for sustainable clean energy strategy in future. By replacing the primary fuel with hydrogen fuel produced using renewable sources in road transport sector, environmental benefits can be achieved. In the present study, techno-economic analysis of hydrogen refuelling station powered by wind-photovoltaics (PV) hybrid power system to be installed in İzmir-Çeşme, Turkey is performed. This analysis is carried out to a design of hydrogen refuelling station which is refuelling 25 fuel cell electric vehicles on a daily basis using hybrid optimisation model for electric renewable (HOMER) software. In this study, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) surface meteorology and solar energy database were used. Therefore, the average wind speed during the year was assessed to be 5.72 m/s and the annual average solar irradiation was used to be 5.08 kW h/m2/day for the considered site. According to optimisation results obtained for the proposed configuration, the levelised cost of hydrogen production was found to be US $7.526–7.866/kg in different system configurations.

Here, we report a nanomaterial consisting of core-shell-shaped Fe–Co3O4 grown on carbon nanotubes (Fe–Co3O4/CNTs) and employed as a bifunctional catalyst for the simultaneous electrocatalysts on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The Fe–Co3O4/CNTs electrocatalyst outperforms the commercial RuO2 catalyst in activity and stability for OER and approaches the performance of Pt/C for HER. Particularly, it shows superior electrocatalytic activity with lowering overpotentials of 120 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for HER and of 300 mV at 10 mA cm−2 for OER in 1 M KOH solution. The superior catalytic activity arises from unique core-shell structure of Fe–Co3O4 and the synergetic chemical coupling effects between Fe–Co3O4 and CNTs. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

In this paper, we present a community microgrid with photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and fuel cell electric vehicles that are used to provide vehicle-to-grid power when renewable power generation is scarce. Excess renewable power generation is used to produce hydrogen, which is stored in a refilling station. A central control system is designed to operate the system in such a way that the operational costs are minimized. To this end, a hybrid model for the system is derived, in which both the characteristics of the fuel cell vehicles and their traveling schedules are considered. The operational costs of the system are formulated considering the presence of uncertainty in the prediction of the load and renewable energy generation.

	abstract = {Many advantages of renewable energies, especially wind energy, such as abundance, permanence, and lack of pollution has encouraged many industrialized and developing countries to focus more on these clean and economic sources of energy. Identifying a good location that is suitable for the construction of a wind farm is one of the important initial steps in harnessing wind energy which is assessed this study. The purpose of this study is to prioritize and rank 13 cities of Fars province in Iran, in terms of their suitability for the construction of a wind farm. Six important criteria were used to prioritize and rank the cities. Wind power density is the most important criterion among these criteria which is calculated by obtaining the 3-h wind speed data between 2004 and 2013. DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) method is used for prioritizing and ranking cities, and then AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process), and FTOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methods are used to assess the validity of results. It is concluded that Izadkhast city is the suggested location for the construction of wind farm. The utilizing a wind-hydrogen energy conversion system will result in a substantial amount of hydrogen production (averagely 21.9 ton/year) when a 900 kW wind turbine is installed in this location. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The aim of this paper is to pinpoint and assess non-economic barriers (NEBs) that can slow down the deployment of hydrogen technologies and infrastructures in Europe. The method includes an expert opinion survey involving selected European experts to identify main NEBs, estimate their impacts, describe their effects, highlight suitable measures to overcome them and pinpoint hitches that make difficult to overtake them. Collecting the information gathered by written questionnaires and in-depth interviews of experts of almost all European countries, the obtained results provide an overall framework of main NEBs identifying the role of forthcoming policies and governmental actions to overcome each barrier. Lastly, preliminary exploitation strategies have been outlined for improving the utilization of hydrogen as an effective energy carrier for storing and to more efficiently use renewable energy produced in Europe. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Global energy consumption is expected to increase significantly due to the growth of the economy and population. The utilization of fossil resource, especially coal, will likely be constrained by carbon dioxide emissions, known to be the principal contributor to climate change. Therefore, the world is facing the challenge of how to utilize fossil resource without a large carbon footprint. In the present work, a nuclear-coal hybrid energy system is proposed as a potential solution to the aforementioned challenge. A high-carbon energy such as coal is integrated effectively with a low-carbon energy such as nuclear in a flexible and optimized manner, which is able to generate the chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide emissions. The nuclear-coal hybrid energy system is presented in this paper for the detailed analysis. In this case, the carbon resource required by the fuel syntheses and chemical production processes is mainly provided by coal while the hydrogen resource is derived from nuclear energy. Such integration can not only lead to a good balance between carbon and hydrogen, but also improve both energy and carbon efficiencies. More importantly, a significantly lower CO2 emission intensity is achieved. A systematic techno-economic model is established, and a scenario analysis is carried out on the hybrid system to assess the economic competitiveness based on the considerations of various types of externalities. It is found that with the rising carbon tax and coal price as well as the decreasing cost of nuclear energy, the hybrid energy system will become more and more economically competitive with the conventional option, which make it a potential viable solution for the future carbon-constrained world. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a novel energy management system for the optimized operation of the energy sources of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy system (wind turbine and photovoltaic) with battery and hydrogen system (fuel cell and electrolyzer). A multi-objective optimization problem based on the weight aggregation approach is formulated by combining three objective functions (operating costs, efficiency and lifetime of the devices) that can conflict with each. The multi-objective function to be optimized by the energy management system is obtained by solving the problem for all the possible cases. Then, the weights that provide the minimum value of the multi-objective function are selected. As the results demonstrate, the multi-objective function becomes a single-objective function that differs according to the net power (power to be generated by/stored in the energy storage devices) and has to be solved in the energy management system of the hybrid system. It simplifies considerably the multi-objective problem implemented in the energy management system, while taking into account the three control objectives that can conflict with each other, which is the main contribution of this paper. This optimal energy management system is solved using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, tested by simulations of the hybrid power generation system throughout 25 years (the expected lifetime of the system), and compared with the results obtained by the energy management systems based on optimizing each single-objective function separately, and by that based on optimizing the multi-objective function combining the three single-objective functions equally weighted. The results demonstrate that this energy management system achieves reasonable operating costs, efficiency and degradation of the devices. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The existing power system of the island of Milos, which is based on fossil fuel generators and a small wind park, is assessed in the context of this paper. System level simulation results, from both technical and economic point of view, are presented for the currently existing and the proposed island's hybrid power system. The latter integrates a higher number of wind turbines and hydrogen technologies as energy storage medium, and the two system architectures are being compared taking into account not only technical and economic parameters but also Green House - Gas (GHG) emissions, fossil fuels consumption and Renewable Energy Sources (RES) penetration increase. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in order to determine the contribution of hydrogen technologies equipment costs; with the cost of energy produced (COE) being the critical parameter. Results show that COE for the proposed power system is higher than the existing one, but on the other hand GHG emissions and fossil fuel consumption are significantly reduced. In addition, RES penetration increases dramatically and the sensitivity analysis indicates that a further reduction in hydrogen technologies equipment and subsidy on wind turbine costs would make RES & Hydrogen-based systems economically competitive to the existing power system of the island.

The first PSO-based EMS tries to minimize the ESS utilization costs, the second one to maximize the ESS efficiency, and the third one to optimize the lifetime of the ESS devices. Long-term simulations of 25 years (expected lifetime of the hybrid system) are shown in order to demonstrate the right performance of the three EMSs and their differences. The simulations show that: 1) each EMS outperforms the others in the designed target; and 2) the third EMS is considered the best EMS, because it needs the least ESS devices, and presents the lowest total acquisition cost of hybrid system, whereas the rest of parameters are similar to the best values obtained by the other EMSs. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {South East Europe is the region in a part of Europe with approximately 65.5 million inhabitants, making up 8.9% of Europe's total population. The countries concerned have distinct geographical features, various climates and significant differences in gross domestic product per capita, so the integration of their energy systems is considered to be a challenging task. Large differences between energy mixes, still largely dominated by fossil-fuel consumption, make this task even more demanding. This paper presents the transition steps to a 100% renewable energy system which need to be carried out until the year 2050 in order to achieve zero carbon energy society. Novelty of this paper compared to other papers with similar research goals is the assumed sustainable use of biomass in the 100% renewable energy system of the region considered. It is important to emphasize here that only the sustainable use of biomass can be considered carbon-neutral. The resulting biomass consumption of the model was 725.94 PJ for the entire region, which is in line with the biomass potential of the region. Modelling the zero-carbon energy system was carried out using the smart energy system concept, together with its main integration pillars, i.e. power-to-heat and power-to-gas technologies. The resulting power generation mix shows that a wide variety of energy sources need to be utilized and no single energy source has more than a 30% share, which also increases the security of supply. Wind turbines and photovoltaics are the main technologies with shares of 28.9% and 22.5%, followed by hydro power, concentrated solar power, biomass (mainly used in cogeneration units) and geothermal energy sources. To keep the biomass consumption within the sustainability limits, there is a need for some type of synthetic fuel in the transportation sector. Nevertheless, achieving 100% renewable energy system also promises to be financially beneficial, as the total calculated annual socio-economic cost of the region is approximately 20 billion euros lower in the year 2050 than in the base year. Finally, energy efficiency measures will play an important role in the transition to the zero-carbon energy society: the model shows that primary energy supply will be 50.9% lower than in the base year. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

One is that we based on A1T society of SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenario) of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) compared to existing studies on those of B1 or B2. The second one is that various innovative technologies were considered and incorporated, such as biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and advanced nuclear technologies including hydrogen or synfuel production. We conducted global modeling over the period 2010-2150 in which energy, materials, and biomass and foods supply costs were minimized by linear programming. We found following features of energy supply structure in A1T scenario. Since the electric demand in A1T scenario in 2100 is two times larger than the others, (1) renewable energy which solely produce electricity, nuclear, and fossil energy with CCS (FECCS) especially coal are main sources of electricity, (2) renewable which can supply heat, namely BECCS and geothermal, satisfies the sector, and (3) hydrogen from coal is introduced in transport sector. It can be concluded that the zero emission energy systems with global economic growth will be possible, by development and deployment of ambitious advanced energy technologies. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Chemical looping hydrogen (CLH) process with renewable energy sources as fuel shows the potential of producing pure hydrogen with inherent capture of CO2 in a low-cost and sustainable way. The heavy fraction (HF) of bio-oil, derived from the fast pyrolysis of biomass and characterized as an energy carrier with difficulty in upgrading itself to bio-fuel or chemicals, was used in this study to generate H2. Four low-cost iron-based oxygen carriers including an ilmenite and three iron ores were initially evaluated with respect to their reducibility and the ability to minimize carbon or iron carbide (Fe3C) formation in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The reactivity and cyclic performance of the selected best candidate was then assessed in a laboratory scale fixed-bed reactor with HF bio-oil as fuel. The screening test in TGA showed that ilmenite was superior over the three iron ores in terms of promoting CO conversion and minimizing carbon or Fe3C formation. Ilmenite could maintain its increasing reducibility with the increase of surrounding CO concentration, in contrast with the iron ores that were deactivated seriously by the formed carbon or Fe3C. Subsequent CLH test with ilmenite and HF bio-oil showed that the reducibility and H2 production capacity of ilmenite were strongly dependent on the operating temperature. The steam oxidation step at 950 °C yielded H2 concentration and hydrogen yield exceeding all of those observed at the other investigated temperatures because of the deepest reduction degree of ilmenite at 950 °C. The decrease in the reducibility and H2 production capacity of ilmenite in the cyclic test could be ascribed to the poorer physical structure of ilmenite with cycles. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {We present a new optimization-based approach for design and operation of a renewable hydrogen system from various types of biomass. To achieve this goal, we develop an optimization model (mixed integer linear programming) which determines the optimal logistics decision-making to minimize the total annual cost for a comprehensive biomass-to-hydrogen (B2H2) supply chain with import and inventory strategies. With the proposed approach we can identify the optimal design of the supply chain and main cost-drivers, manage logistics operations against fluctuations of biomass availability and hydrogen demand, and make strategic decisions for planning the B2H2 system such as capital investment and energy import planning. To validate the model, a case study of an upcoming B2H2 supply chain for the transportation sector at Jeju Island, Korea, is analyzed. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to provide insights into the efficient management of the B2H2 supply chain. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {High penetration of renewable energy requires high reliability to compensate the intermittency of the sources, which is generally tackled by using energy storage systems. However, the selection of the storage technology is not an easy task; it depends on parameters like efficiency, self-discharge, investment costs, etc. Among the different alternatives, hydrogen storage systems present several advantages, such as its low investment costs and in existent self-discharge, but comparatively, it presents low efficiency. This paper introduces the experimental results of controlling a hydrogen storage system connected to a micro-grid based on renewable generation. The research has been carried out in LabDER at the Universitat Politècnica de València, a controlled laboratory designed for the study of distributed energy resources. During the research, a specific control system has been designed and assembled to regulate the hydrogen production, consuming just the excess of energy produced by the renewable sources. The paper includes the design process of the controller, including the experimental characterization of the elements and the experimental results of such control.

It is a prospective study, where the scope is to describe the characteristics of current power systems (like the generation technologies, load curves and grid constraints), and define future scenarios of hydrogen for balancing the electrical grids, considering the efficiency, economy and easiness of operations. We focus in the 'Spanish case' which is a good example for planning the transition from a power system holding large reserve capacities, high penetration of renewable energies and limited interconnections, to a more sustainable energy system being capable to optimize the volumes, the regulation modes, the utilization ratios and the impacts of the installations. Thus, we explore a novel aspect of the 'hydrogen economy' which is based in the potentials of existing power systems and the properties of hydrogen as energy carrier, by considering the electricity generation and demand globally and determining the optimal size and operation of the hydrogen production processes along the country; e.g. the cost production of hydrogen becomes viable for a base-load scenario with 58 TWh/year of power surplus at 0.025 €/kWh, and large number electrolyzer plants (50 MW) running in variable mode (1-12 kA/m2).

	abstract = {The need for electrical energy storage (EES) is being driven by the deployment of increasing amounts of intermittent renewable energy resources. In addition to their fuel flexibility, high efficiency, scalability, and long-term cost outlook, reversible (regenerative) solid oxide cell (rSOC) systems have the potential for round-trip efficiencies competitive with the other available energy storage technologies. Accordingly, the focus of the current study is to investigate modeling methods for high temperature rSOCs in order to facilitate future endeavors related to establishing optimal operating conditions and system designs. Previously developed solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and solid-oxide electrolytic cell (SOEC) models are integrated to form a general rSOC model. The model is first calibrated and validated based on the available experimental data in the extant literature. The validation results show that the fitting parameters extracted from the calibration study can precisely simulate the cell behavior under various operating conditions. The effects of key operating parameters, such as temperature, gas composition and fuel utilization, on the voltage-current density performance characteristic and thermoneutral voltage are then investigated. It is also observed that the total electrochemical losses of the cell can be significantly different in each operating mode (fuel cell and electrolyzing) under certain operating conditions. Advantages of pressurized operation on thermal management are also discussed. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Owing to the increasingly apparent climate change, it becomes imperative to use renewable energy in the production of fuel that is environmentally friendly. At the same time, there is a need to introduce the related education programs to develop the skills of the technical staff working at the front line of rapidly developing renewable energy technologies. Hydrogen is expected to be the fuel in the near future. At present hydrogen fuel is mainly produced using steam reforming of methane (SRM). However, hydrogen generation using the SRM results in emission of greenhouse gases and climate change. Therefore, there is a common consensus that the SRM technology will soon be challenged by the technologies of solar hydrogen generation using photoelectrochemical cells (PEC). However, the PEC technology will be the ultimate winner only if the effects related to climate change and pollution are fully monetised. While such radical development is difficult for implementation due to economic reasons, the increasingly urgent need to reduce climate change dictates the need to increase competitiveness of the PEC method. This imposes the need to increase the efficiency of the solar energy conversion and reduce the costs of the related raw materials and devices. The development of renewable energy-related technologies, such as those related to solar hydrogen, imposes the need to introduce education programs in order to train technical and research staff working at the front line of rapidly developing sustainable energy systems. The present work considers such programs addressing a range of energy-related topics, such as hydrogen energy, electrochemical energy, photoelectrochemical energy and alternative renewable energy as well as industrial ecology and energy policy. It is concluded that implementation of these programs is urgently needed in order to protect the environment through sustainable development. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The structural and morphological properties of the samples were investigated by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TG-DTA, UV-vis spectroscopy and TEM. A substantial increase of H2 evolution was observed for TiO2-reduced graphene oxide hybrid nanomaterials. This is due to the high migration efficiency of photo-induced electrons and the inhibition of charge-carrier recombination due to the electronic interaction between TiO2 and reduced graphene oxide. i.e, reduced graphene oxide acts as an electron-acceptor which effectively hinders the electron-hole pair recombination of TiO2. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

	abstract = {Water scarcity has become a chronic problem aggravated by climate change. One third of the world's population already lives in areas suffering moderate to high water stress; some 1.5 billion people lack ready access to drinking water. Desalination is in the course of becoming a major source of fresh water by tapping into the vast reserves of seawater and brackish water. Large scale desalination plants use either thermal or membrane processes which consume a great deal of energy. Economic implications of large energy requirements coupled with environmental concerns about carbon emissions spurred a growing interest in developing desalination processes that use renewable energy sources. Among these processes the humidification dehumidification (HD) of air, using solar energy, is a simple technology particularly suited for regions in developing countries where there is very low infrastructure and unskilled manpower. In this paper we review various technologies under investigation to desalinate saline water through HD of air and using solar thermal energy. A particular emphasis will be put on the various types of solar water heaters as well as the various designs of solar air heaters. © 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {As many other small islands and archipelagos, the Canary Islands depend to a high degree on energy imports. Despite its small surface, the archipelago has a high potential for renewable energy (RE) technologies. In this paper, we present a scenario pathway to a 100% RE supply in the Canary Islands by 2050. It relies on a back-casting approach linking the bottom-up accounting framework Mesap-PlaNet and the high resolution power system model REMix. Our analysis shows that locally available technology potentials are sufficient for a fully renewable supply of the islands’ power, heat, and land transport energy demands. To follow the pathway for achieving a carbon neutral supply, expansion of RE technology deployment needs to be accelerated in the short-term and efforts towards greater energy efficiency must be increased. According to our results, an extended linkage between energy sectors through electric vehicles as well as electric heating, and the usage of synthetic hydrogen can contribute notably to the integration of intermittent RE power generation. Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of power transmission in RE supply systems. Supply costs are found 15% lower in a scenario considering sea cable connections between all islands. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The goal of this research is to understand the economics of anticipated large-scale changes in the electric system. 86 million different combinations of renewable generation (wind and solar), natural gas, and three storage types (hydrogen storage, electric vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, and building heat) are modeled within the PJM Interconnection. The corresponding electric systems are then operated and constrained to meet the load every hour over four years. The total cost of each energy system is calculated, both with and without externalities, to find the least cost energy systems. Using today's costs of conventional and renewable electricity and without adding any externalities, the cost-minimum system includes no renewable generation, but does include EVs. When externalities are included, however, the most cost-effective to system covers 50% of the electric load with renewable energy and runs reliably without need for either new conventional generation or purpose-built storage. The three novel energy policy implications of this research are: (1) using today's cost of renewable electricity and estimates of externalities, it is cost effective to implement 240 GW of renewable electricity to meet 50% of the total electric load; (2) there is limited need to construct new natural gas power plants, especially from a system-wide perspective; and (3) existing coal plants may still be useful to the energy system, and instead of being retired, should be repurposed to occasionally provide generation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

In this work exergy efficiency and cost analyses are conducted to compare pathways of hydrogen generation (PEM, alkaline or solid oxide electrolysis), storage (compression, liquefaction or methanation), transportation (trailer or pipeline) and utilization (PEMFC, SOFC or combined cycle gas turbine). All processes were simulated with respect to their full and part-load efficiencies and resulting costs. Furthermore, load profiles were estimated to simulate a whole year of operation at varying loads. The results show power-to-power exergy efficiencies varying between about 17 and 38%. The main losses occur at utilization and generation. Methanation features both lower efficiency and higher costs than compressed hydrogen pathways. While gas turbines show very high efficiency at full load when considering a load following operation they drop significantly while fuel cells can maintain their efficiency. Lower costs are commonly reached at higher overall efficiencies. Installation costs are identified as predominant because of the low amount of full-load hours. An increase of these e.g. by accounting for an electrolysis base-load to provide hydrogen for vehicles shows significant decreases in costs per stored energy. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {Hydrogen and syngas production through a combination of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) and power from renewable energy resources is an efficient production method that has several significant advantages. However, given its relative technological infancy, understanding the intricate reactions and transport processes within SOEC devices are necessary to advance the technology and establish the optimum operating conditions for eventual cost effective design. Consequently, the main objective of this study is to simulate the complex phenomena inside a planar SOEC using a previously developed and validated model. The model takes an intermediate fidelity approach to predicting the electrochemical and thermo-fluid phenomena inside the cell. An example of the model calibration for an electrolyte supported SOEC is presented here. The model is then employed to investigate the effect of various operating parameters connected to SOEC electrochemical performance, as well as hydrogen and syngas production. The effect of the feedstock gas composition, temperature, and flow rate on performance and the important role that the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) plays are illustrated. Although the operating temperature, fuel composition and flow rates have a direct effect on SOEC performance and power consumption, their influence on RWGS is more significant. Possible outlet syngas compositions of an SOEC and their appropriateness as a feedstock for the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) and methanation processes are also discussed. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This hybrid system opens the possibility to optimise operation and to increase operation times of the system and thus to improve the techno-economic performance. To analyse the performance, a model has been developed, which designs and operates a single or hybrid power-to-gas system in a cost optimal manner. The underlying method is a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach, which minimises total system costs. The cost optimisation modelling is performed by a case study for a hybrid electrolyser/battery system directly coupled with a large PV power plant without grid connection. The results show, that batteries can support electrolyser operation in a reasonable way. This is however associated with higher hydrogen production costs and not competitive compared to the installation of additional electrolyser capacity or curtailment of electricity. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Fuel cell cars powered by hydrogen enable CO2-emission free mobility. A main requirement for the success of this technology is the availability of an area-wide and affordable hydrogen supply. A significant cost factor in the hydrogen supply chain is the multi-stage gas compression to provide the mandatory filling pressure for the pressurized tanks. One way to address this issue is to perform the hydrogen production process at elevated pressure. In this paper the feasibility of compressed hydrogen production without additional gas compression based on the steam iron process is discussed. Experiments were performed in a lab-scale test rig using fixed bed reactor technology. The focus was to evaluate the influence of pressurized hydrogen production on the cycle stability, on the conversion efficiency and on the structural integrity of a Fe2O3-Al2O3 (90 + 10 wt%) oxygen carrier. The oxidations were performed at different pressure levels of 7-22 bar (g) at a temperature of 750 °C with steam. The steady steam supply was ensured by a HPLC pump which delivered 0.03 g min-1 (at room temperature) of water, which was evaporated in the heated inlet section. The water was introduced for approximately 100 min until the oxygen carrier was fully oxidized. The iron oxide was reduced in the subsequent reaction steps at 750 °C and ambient pressure with 25 Nml min-1 H2 as reducing agent. The reduction reactions were analyzed to evaluate possible influences of its prior oxidations. The results revealed no signs of negative repercussions. The oxygen carrier conversion of initially 84% remained at a steady behavior between the 15 performed cycles. Only small losses of 0.8% per cycle caused by thermal sintering of the contact mass were observed, which was independent from the different pressure levels of the prior oxidations. The evaluation of the pressurized oxidations did not reveal any performance decrease as well. The rise of pressure in each oxidation showed a consistent characteristic throughout the complete test series. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the oxygen carrier sample after the experiment revealed some structural changes, which are related to thermal sintering but the structural integrity of the sample stayed intact. The oxidations yielded an average of 18 mmol gFe-1 hydrogen with a maximum hydrogen pressure of 22 bar (g). The conducted experiments showed that the steam iron process is very suitable for the production of compressed hydrogen and that the process is not negatively influenced by the elevated system pressure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Wave energy production seems more suited, at least in the beginning, for shoreline converters in Eregli. Eregli has suitable areas for the installation of an oscillating water column and tapered channel systems in terms of its geological features. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Current energy-storage technologies are, however, not suitable for such an energy system because the technologies are cost ineffective and achieve low energy-conversion efficiency. The most realistic and expected technology is hydrogen generation from water splitting by an electrochemical cell directly connected with photovoltaic cell. In this study, a simple concept is proposed for generating hydrogen from water splitting by using a direct-electrically-connected polymer electrolyte electrochemical cell and a separately-located concentrated photovoltaic cell, named a "concentrated photovoltaic electrochemical cell (CPEC)". The CPEC operates stably and achieves relatively high-energy conversion efficiency from light to hydrogen of over 12%.

	abstract = {The issue of limited fossil fuels combined with the vast technological improvements in recent years has initiated numerous installations of renewable power production, particularly in form of photovoltaic cells and wind turbines. Since the volatile character of wind and solar radiation leads to a fluctuating power production, these renewables are incapable of providing reliable base load power. To enable the transition to a renewable energy system, large-scale energy storage is required to compensate for short-term and seasonal imbalances and to save temporary excess power. Due to the order of magnitude involved, this can best be achieved by converting electricity into hydrogen via electrolysis, a process that is also called "power to gas". Hereby, hydrogen can serve as a link combining the electricity, traffic and heating sector into one energy market. This paper presents the process chains of different power-to-gas paths, including different transformation technologies, which it evaluates with regard to their suitability for applications, the optional methanation step including the necessary production of CO2, distribution options and geological storage options as well as end-user applications. Finally, the use of hydrogen and methane in transportation and reconversion to power are compared from the economic point of view. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

	abstract = {The future of urban energy systems relies on the transition to "smart energy networks" which incorporate energy storage with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. Hydrogen provides a desirable energy vector for both energy storage and exchange of energy between energy hubs within a smart energy network. This paper aims to develop a generic mathematical model for the optimal energy management of future communities where hydrogen is used as an energy vector. An energy hub is a novel concept that systematically and holistically considers the energy requirements of both mobility and stationary loads. In order to perform optimization studies, the minimization of capital cost of hydrogen refueling stations and operation and maintenance cost of all energy hubs within the network are considered. The modeling and optimization are undertaken and carried out in the General Algebraic Modeling Software (GAMS). The case study considers four energy hubs consisting of a commercial building, school, residential complex, as well as hydrogen refueling stations. The study investigates the optimal operation of different energy conversion and storage technologies in order to meet the demand of energy. The results showed that the optimum size of electrolyser and hydrogen tank for supplying the hydrogen demand in the energy hub network is two 290-kW electrolysers and four 30-kg tanks, respectively. The average daily strike price of electricity by which the electrolyser operates is $0.036 per kWh and will not operate when the average hourly Ontario electricity price is higher than $0.13 per kWh. The levelized cost of hydrogen produced by hydrogen refueling station is estimated to be $6.74 per kg. Moreover, the optimal operation of energy conversion and energy storage technologies within each hub and the optimal interaction between energy hubs with in the network are also investigated. In addition, it is shown that distributed hydrogen generation is more preferable than H2 delivery in environmental and economic comparison. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the feasibility of using an electrochemical process to convert excess renewable electricity and biogas into hythane gas, which has higher value than biogas and can be stored and transported using current natural gas infrastructure. The electrochemical process utilizes the protons generated in water electrolysis to liberate cations in silicate minerals, which in turn forms metal hydroxide and efficiently captures the CO2 present in biogas. The H2 produced in electrolysis is blended with purified biogas to generate mixed hythane product, which has a higher combustion rate in methane fueled vehicles. Results show that under a voltage of 3.5–4.0 V, the system reduced CO2 in biogas from the original 40% to less than 15% and increased the heat value of the gas product from 534 kJ/mol to over 669 kJ/mol. Preliminary techno-economic analysis showed a net profit of $0.28 per thousand ft.cu hythane generated when standard grid electricity is used, and the profit may be increased by orders of magnitude if excess renewable electricity is used.

	abstract = {An initial assessment of the production potential of H2 by electrolysis is performed in Ecuador with electricity from renewable sources. The renewable energies considered are: solar photovoltaic, wind, geothermal and hydropower. The information about their potential is based on maps of solar and wind resources, geothermal surveys, as well as estimates on mini-hydro and spilled turbinable energy from hydroelectric plants with reservoir. The amount of H2 is obtained by considering a PEM electrolizer, with an efficiency of 75%, reaching a production of 4.55 × 108 kg/year in a likely scenario. Two different uses of H2 are presented: 1) automotive transportation, replacing gasoline and diesel and, 2) rural energy, replacing firewood for cooking in rural households in the country. As a result, H2 is able to replace 65% and 44% of the volumes of imported gasoline and diesel, respectively and the overall replacement of gasoline in 9 out of 23 provinces. Also, it is possible the total replacement of firewood in rural households in 20 provinces, and, under certain conditions, the H2 surplus could be used to completely cover the electricity needs in the same rural households in 20 provinces. It is concluded that, there are certain opportunities in Ecuador to include H2 in its energy matrix, contributing to improve the supply of secondary energy, raising the life quality in rural areas, mitigation of environmental pollution and strengthening the national economy. All this makes necessary to conduct more detailed technical and economic studies. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates hydrogen and methane generation from large hydraulic plant, using an original multilevel thermo-economic optimization approach developed by the authors.Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis employing time-dependent hydraulic energy related to the water which is not normally used by the plant, known as "spilled water electricity". Both the demand for spilled energy and the electrical grid load vary widely by time of year, therefore a time-dependent hour-by-hour one complete year analysis has been carried out, in order to define the optimal plant size. This time period analysis is necessary to take into account spilled energy and electrical load profiles variability during the year.The hydrogen generation plant is based on 1MWe water electrolysers fuelled with the "spilled water electricity", when available; in the remaining periods, in order to assure a regular H2 production, the energy is taken from the electrical grid, at higher cost. To perform the production plant size optimization, two hierarchical levels have been considered over a one year time period, in order to minimize capital and variable costs.After the optimization of the hydrogen production plant size, a further analysis is carried out, with a view to converting the produced H2 into methane in a chemical reactor, starting from H2 and CO2 which is obtained with CCS plants and/or carried by ships. For this plant, the optimal electrolysers and chemical reactors system size is defined.For both of the two solutions, thermo-economic optimization results are discussed and compared with particular emphasis to energy scenario, economic aspects, system size, capital costs and related investments. It is worth noting that the results reported here for this particular large H2 plant case represents a general methodology, since it can vary according to their different sizes, primary renewable energy, plant location, and different H2 utilization. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Interest in power-to-gas (P2G) as an energy storage technology is increasing, since it allows to utilise the existing natural gas infrastructure as storage medium, which reduces capital investments and facilitates its deployment. P2G systems using renewable electricity can also substitute for fossil fuels used for heating and transport. In this study, both techno-economic and life cycle assessment (LCA) are applied to determine key performance indicators for P2G systems generating hydrogen or methane (synthetic natural gas – SNG) as main products. The proposed scenarios assume that P2G systems participate in the Swiss wholesale electricity market and include several value-adding services in addition to the generation of low fossil-carbon gas. We find that none of the systems can compete economically with conventional gas production systems when only selling hydrogen and SNG. For P2G systems producing hydrogen, four other services such as heat and oxygen supply are needed to ensure the economic viability of a 1 MW P2H system. CO2 captured from the air adds $50/MW ht of extra levelised cost to SNG compared to CO2 supplied from biogas upgrading plants and it does not offer an economic case yet regardless of the number of services. As for environmental performance, only the input of “clean” renewable electricity to electrolysis result in environmental benefits for P2G compared to conventional gas production. In particular, more than 90% of the life cycle environmental burdens are dominated by the electricity supply to electrolysis for hydrogen production, and the source of CO2 in case of SNG. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

The evaluated co-gasification cases were evaluated in term of key plant performance indicators for generation of totally or partially decarbonized energy vectors (power, hydrogen, substitute natural gas, liquid fuels by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis). The work streamlines one significant advantage of gasification process, namely the capability to process lower grade fuels on condition of high energy efficiency. Introduction in the evaluated IGCC-based schemes of carbon capture step (based on pre-combustion capture) significantly reduces CO2 emissions, the carbon capture rate being higher than 90% for decarbonized energy vectors (power and hydrogen) and in the range of 47-60% for partially decarbonized energy vectors (SNG, liquid fuels). Various plant concepts were assessed (e.g. 420-425 MW net power with 0-200 MWth flexible hydrogen output, 800 MWth SNG, 700 MWth liquid fuel, all of them with CCS).

This problem is solved by implementing an É-constraint method. The solution consists of a Pareto front, corresponding to different design strategies in the associated variable space. Multiple choice decision making is then recommended to find the best solution through an M-TOPSIS analysis.

	abstract = {To develop an environmentally acceptable refuelling solution for fuel cell-powered unmanned aerial systems (UASs) to operate in remote areas, hydrogen fuel must be produced on-site from renewable energy sources. This paper describes a Matlab-based simulation tool specifically developed to pre-design offgrid hydrogen refuelling systems for UAS applications. The refuelling system comprises a high concentrated PV array (CPV), an electrolyser, a hydrogen buffer tank and a diaphragm hydrogen compressor. Small composite tanks are also included for fast refuelling of the UAV platforms at any time during the year. The novel approach of selecting a CPV power source is justified on the basis of minimizing the system footprint (versus flat plat or low concentration PV), aiming for a containerized remotely deployable UAS offgrid refuelling solution.To validate the simulation tool a number of simulations were performed using experimental data from a prototype offgrid hydrogen refuelling station for UAVs developed by Boeing Research & Technology Europe. Solar irradiation data for a selected location and daily UAS hydrogen demands of between 2.8 and 15.8Nm3 were employed as the primary inputs, in order to calculate a recommended system sizing solution and assess the expected operation of the refuelling system across a given year. The specific energy consumption of the refuelling system obtained from the simulations is between 5.6 and 8.9kWhe per kg of hydrogen delivered to the UAVs, being lower for larger daily hydrogen demands. Increasing the CPV area and electrolyser size in order to supply higher daily hydrogen demands (e.g., above 10Nm3 H2 per day) improves the system operability. However this can imply excessive system size and costs, jeopardizing the techno-economic feasibility of a remotely deployable off-grid refuelling solution. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {In the present study, a hybrid renewable energy system using hydrogen energy as energy storage option is conceptually modeled for the Bozcaada Island in Turkey. The system is investigated from the techno-economic point of view. The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) tool is used to define the optimum size of the equipment based on the geographical and meteorological data of the island. The HOMER uses the net present cost (NPC) method while ranking the system suitability. Also, the cost of energy (COE) is calculated with the total annual cost (ACT). The study considers two scenarios, which are only wind turbine and wind turbine/PV hybrid systems. Using the wind turbine/PV array system, instead of wind turbine only, decreases the NPC from $14,624,343 to $11,960,698. Also, it decreases the hydrogen tank capacity to 400 kg and hence affects other equipment size and NPC. So, the COE varies between $1.016/kWh and $0.83/kWh. According to this, the optimum system components are defined as PV array-300 kW, wind turbine (E33x2), fuel cell-100 kW, converter-150 kW, electrolyzer-200 kW and hydrogen tank-400 kg to supply a 1875 kWh/d primary load. Furthermore, the effects of some parameters and the equipment on NPC are examined. Increasing potential of the renewable energy sources, such as annual average wind speed or solar radiation, decreases both COE and NPC. While the annual average solar radiation increases to 5 kWh/m2/d, the NPC and COE decrease to $11,673,704 and $0.81/kWh. Likewise, an increase in the annual average wind speed will decrease the costs to $11,452,712 and $0.795/kWh, respectively. Also, increasing the real interest i, to 5% increases the COE to $1.043/kWh, as expected. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

The economic feasibility is examined here of using hybrid systems to supply the energy needs for a household in Tehran, Iran. Wind-photovoltaic-diesel hybrid systems are considered in this investigation. Hydrogen is employed by the diesel generator so as to ensure a clean fuel is used, leading to little environmental impact. In addition, battery storage is utilized in the system reliability assessment. HOMER software is utilized for the economic assessment and optimization. The key factors considered in the investigation are as follows: incident solar radiation, wind speed, electrical demand profile for the household, equipment characteristics, and hydrogen fuel costs. The average daily electricity consumption, averaged over an annual cycle, is 17 kWh/d, and the peak electrical demand is 1.5 kW, for the household considered. The electrical supply system is required to satisfy these requirements. The analysis results from the case study show that, among five hybrid systems for supplying electrical requirements, the most economical is the wind-hydrogen-battery hybrid system, which has a total net present cost of US$63,190 and a cost of energy of US$0.783/kWh (based on 2015 US$). © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.},

The objective function includes minimization of total daily social cost of the hydrogen supply chain network with uncertain demand. There are several factors and key attributes, which influence consumer choice to buy a fuel cell vehicle. At the same time, consumer preference on the demand side is the most important factor in predicting changes in the auto market.

	abstract = {Renewable generating systems are alternative to produce electric energy in a clean manner. However, the high costs of the constituents limit their broad use. Thus, sizing is an important issue in the renewable generating systems design, in order to reach an efficient relationship between cost and benefit. Likewise, the random nature of the sources makes the sizing a complex task with regard to a conventional system. This paper is focused on calculate the optimal size of a wind-photovoltaic-fuel cell system to meet the power demand of an isolated residential load located in the south-east region of Mexico (Chetumal city 18°31′21.4″N 88°16′11.3″W), with a solar radiation range from 0 to 0.75 kW/m2 and wind speed range from 5 to 7.8 m/s. Swarm intelligence techniques have been successfully applied in solving many combinatorial optimization problems in which the objective space possesses many local optimal solutions. This work employs the Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) algorithm to search the optimal sizing for the power plant minimizing the total costs of the system; as a metaheuristic procedure, the PSO was able to find the best configuration regardless the lack of a deep knowledge of the problem. Compared against the Differential Evolution (DE) technique, the PSO performance is faster and able to provide a configuration that saves around 10% of the total cost of the hybrid system. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

One of these applications is Hydrogen production station working by solar energy to use in fuel cell vehicle. Time consuming aspect of solar-hydrogen production is the most prominent reason for presenting a new scheme as a parking-refueling station for fuel cell vehicles in this study. To do this, Simulation, economic and environmental evaluations of the solar parking-refueling station are considered in this article. Because of using an independent hydrogen compression system, the suggested parking-refueling station can be used in a standalone area such as rural and military applications. Results show that the proposed system seems to be economic in present condition. It also illustrates that the Levelized Cost of Product (Km-Passenger) is in a range of 0.15-0.28 US$.

Significant reductions in greenhouse gas and criteria air contaminant emissions are predicted from all three hydrogen production methods in all four provinces, except for electrolysis in Alberta where most electricity is generated from fossil fuels. Thermochemical hydrogen production shows the most favorable results in all provinces due to the prospective use of renewable waste heat, followed by electrolysis from renewable hydroelectric power in Quebec and British Columbia. The sweet spot in terms of life cycle emission reductions is obtained when a renewable energy source for production is combined with a low-emission electricity source for compression and distribution, for example by utilizing waste heat and electricity from nuclear power in Ontario. The lowest fuel costs are predicted for hydrogen produced from natural gas, which is abundant in Canada and can provide a reasonable balance between emission reductions and economic benefits for FCV implementation across all provinces. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the significance of CO2-free hydrogen is discussed using a long-term global energy system. The energy demand–supply system including CO2-free hydrogen was assumed, though there are still large uncertainties as to whether a global CO2-free hydrogen energy system will be deployed. System analysis was conducted using the global and long-term intertemporal optimization energy model GRAPE under severe CO2 emission constraints. Applied global CO2 constraints for 2050 were a 50% reduction from 1990 levels. CO2 constraints accounting for Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) in each region were also considered. A variety of energy resources and technologies were considered in this model. Hydrogen can be produced from low-grade coal or natural gas with CO2 capture and electricity from renewable energy. The hydrogen CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) price for Japan was about 3.2 cents/MJ in 2030. Hydrogen demand technologies considered in this paper are hydrogen-fired power plants, direct combustion, combined heat and power (fuel cells, gas engines, and gas turbines), fuel cell vehicles, and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles. The majority of CO2-free hydrogen was deployed in the transportation sector. CO2-free hydrogen was utilized in the power sector, where deployment of other zero emission technology has some constraints. From an economic viewpoint, CO2-free hydrogen can reduce the global energy system cost. From the viewpoint of a localized region, such as Japan, deployment of CO2-free hydrogen can improve energy security and environmental indicators. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper aims to investigate a system for large size hydrogen production, storage and distribution to refueling stations for its employment in land transportation. Hydrogen is produced by pressurized alkaline electrolysers, employing time-dependent renewable electricity produced by a large size hydroelectric plant (100 MW); the hydrogen is stored into pressurized tanks and delivered by trucks to the refueling stations. Since the technologies related to hydrogen vehicles still present high costs, an alternative solution is investigated: the hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is converted into Hydro-methane (a blend of methane and hydrogen, where H2 maximum volume content is 30%), which is easier to be stored and transported to the refueling stations, considering its higher energy content in volume terms. Since electricity available from the hydroelectric plant varies widely throughout the year, a time-dependent hierarchical thermo-economic analysis is performed in order to investigate both the optimal size of the whole plant and the management of the alkaline electrolysers. The analysis is carried out for the H2 and Hydro-methane plant lay-outs, comparing the results from energetic, strategic and economic point of view in a typical European economic scenario (Italy). For the different plant lay-outs, two energy scenarios are considered: (i) to feed the electrolysers only with renewable hydroelectricity during the year, keeping them off when it is not available; (ii) to purchase electricity from the national grid in shortage periods, in order to increase the utilization factor of the electrolysers and the production of H2 and Hydro-methane for the refueling stations. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

The analysis is based on a model that includes both technological and economic components. It assumes that electricity is produced through wind turbines and photovoltaic systems. The produced electricity can be stored by conversion to hydrogen through electrolysis and reconversion through thermal energy converters. The system stores the produced hydrogen using Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC). As carrier material, dibenzyltoluene is selected. The model includes investment costs and calculations to conduct economic analysis. It is used to create economically optimized systems that give realistic cost estimations. Technical and economic data are taken from in-house experiments, quotes from manufacturers and literature. The application is evaluated for the electricity supply to a BMW Group production site located in Germany. Results show that at present, converting excess energy to heat is a more economical option than electricity storage using LOHC. However, if the goal is to provide a majority (>75%) of the needed electricity with on-site renewable energy, an energy storage system becomes economical to use today.

	abstract = {Hydrogen production via steam methane reforming (SMR) dominates the supply to refining complexes worldwide, resulting in significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a considerable demand for clean hydrogen pathways that are economically competitive with SMR. The development of a 563 MW integrated wind-hydrogen model with energy storage is proposed. The model utilizes real-time wind energy data to ascertain the optimal size of the electrolyser, the number of electrolyser units and the battery (energy storage) capacity that will yield a minimum hydrogen production cost, whilst functioning in a liberalized electricity market with dynamic prices. The optimal plant configuration consists of 81 units of a 3496 kW (760 Nm3/hr) electrolyser and 360 MWh (60 units) of battery capacity. For the minimum hydrogen production cost determined ($9.00//kg H2), the wind farm accounts for 63% of this cost. Hence, if existing wind farm assets are used, such that the investment cost of building the wind-hydrogen plant does not include the wind farm costs, the hydrogen production cost is reduced to $3.37/kg H2. For a particular electrolyser-battery configuration, it was observed that the minimum hydrogen production cost occurs when their respective capacity factors are approximately equivalent. The benefits of energy storage are limited by the decrease in overall plant efficiency, which results from the use of the battery. For the techno-economic conditions considered in this paper, hydrogen production costs from wind powered electrolysis ($3.37 to $9.00/kg H2) are uncompetitive with SMR/SMR-CCS ($1.87 to $2.60/kg H2). © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.},

Yet, the development of a hydrogen economy suffers from a lack of infrastructure to store and supply H2 fuel to the refuelling stations, while at the same time, hydrogen can be just seen as one alternative among others to compete with the current fossil fuels. To determine if hydrogen is a competitive option, many scenarios must be assessed considering not only the cost as the target to determine the feasibility but, also environmental and safety objectives. This work is focused on the design of a hydrogen supply chain for deployment scenarios in the Midi-Pyrénées region in France based on multi-objective optimization. Specific constraints related to the energy sources have been integrated and a multi-period long-term problem is examined (2020-2050). Two solution strategies will be implemented to solve this multi-period problem: a global optimization through ε-constraint method and a sequential optimization through lexicographic and ε-constraint methods. The consideration of different geographical scales and the impact of the initiation step in the development of a sustainable supply chain have been highlighted.

The demand for liquid hydrogen (LH2), particularly driven by clean fuel cell applications, is expected to rise in the near future.

The barriers of built hydrogen liquefiers is the low exergy efficiency and the high specific liquefaction costs. Exergy efficiency improvements, however, are limited by economic viability. The focus of this paper is to present a roadmap for the scale-up of hydrogen liquefaction technology, from state-of-the-art plants to newly developed large-scale liquefaction processes. The work is aimed at reducing the specific liquefaction costs by finding an optimal trade-off between capital costs and operating costs. To this end, two developed hydrogen liquefaction processes were optimized for specific energy consumption and specific liquefaction costs, showing the potential to reduce the specific liquefaction costs by 67% for a 100 tpd LH2 plant compared to a conventional 5 tpd LH2 plant while achieving a specific energy consumption between 5.9 and 6.6 kWh per kg LH2 with technology that is or will be available within 5 years. The results make liquid hydrogen a viable distribution route for hydrogen for mobility. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The increasing awareness on the risky state of conventional energy sources in terms of future energy supply security and health of environment has promoted the research activities on alternative energy systems. However, due to the fact that the power production of main alternative sources such as wind and solar is directly related with meteorological conditions, these sources should be combined with dispatchable energy sources in a hybrid combination in order to ensure security of demand supply. In this study, the evaluation of such a hybrid system consisting of wind, solar, hydrogen and thermal power systems in the concept of virtual power plant strategy is realized. An economic operation-based load dispatching strategy that can interactively adapt to the real measured wind and solar power production values is proposed. The adaptation of the load dispatching algorithm is provided by the update mechanism employed in the meteorological condition forecasting algorithms provided by the combination of Empirical Mode Decomposition, Cascade-Forward Neural Network and Linear Model through a fusion strategy. Thus, the effects of the stochastic nature of solar and wind energy systems are better overcome in order to participate in the electricity market with higher benefits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the optimal design and operation of integrated wind-hydrogen-electricity networks using the general mixed integer linear programming energy network model, STeMES (Samsatli and Samsatli, 2015). The network comprises: wind turbines; electrolysers, fuel cells, compressors and expanders; pressurised vessels and underground storage for hydrogen storage; hydrogen pipelines and electricity overhead/underground transmission lines; and fuelling stations and distribution pipelines. The spatial distribution and temporal variability of energy demands and wind availability were considered in detail in the model. The suitable sites for wind turbines were identified using GIS, by applying a total of 10 technical and environmental constraints (buffer distances from urban areas, rivers, roads, airports, woodland and so on), and used to determine the maximum number of new wind turbines that can be installed in each zone. The objective is the minimisation of the total cost of the network, subject to satisfying all of the demands of the domestic transport sector in Great Britain. The model simultaneously determines the optimal number, size and location of each technology, whether to transmit the energy as electricity or hydrogen, the structure of the transmission network, the hourly operation of each technology and so on. The cost of distribution was estimated from the number of fuelling stations and length of the distribution pipelines, which were determined from the demand density at the 1 km level. Results indicate that all of Britain's domestic transport demand can be met by on-shore wind through appropriately designed and operated hydrogen-electricity networks. Within the set of technologies considered, the optimal solution is: to build a hydrogen pipeline network in the south of England and Wales; to supply the Midlands and Greater London with hydrogen from the pipeline network alone; to use Humbly Grove underground storage for seasonal storage and pressurised vessels at different locations for hourly balancing as well as seasonal storage; for Northern Wales, Northern England and Scotland to be self-sufficient, generating and storing all of the hydrogen locally. These results may change with the inclusion of more technologies, such as electricity storage and electric vehicles. © 2015 The Authors.},

	abstract = {An initial estimation of the potential for hydrogen (H2) production in Venezuela is made, obtained by water electrolysis using electricity from renewable sources, taking advantage of the great potential of the country for solar, wind and mini hydro energies. For the first two, its potential maps is obtained from insolation and wind speed maps, respectively, prepared from satellite data, and for mini-hydro, the potential is obtained from documentary information. To calculate the amount of H2 to produce is used the Higher Heating Value, considering the electrolytic system overall efficiency of 75%, including power requirements of the electrolyzer, auxiliary equipment, and system losses. In addition, in the calculation of usable renewable potential are excluded land areas under special administration, marine, lake and urban areas, and other limitations are considered concerning energy conversion efficiencies and useful areas available for the location of the different renewable technologies. The results give a total production of 2.073 × 1010 kg of H2/year, with a contribution of 95% of solar photovoltaic energy. The H2 produced covers entirely the energy requirements of rural population without energy service, and the remainder could be used as a chemical feedstock in industrial processes such as oil refining or petrochemical, whose demand in not entirely satisfied with the annual production of H2 from the country, or even for export. It is concluded that the results are the initial point of a detailed research, with more accurate estimation of the potentials that include economic and social topics related with the production on H2, on the way to determine the feasibility of developing of the Solar-H2 system, in its different forms in Venezuela.

This paper presents a stochastic approach to solving a combined optimization problem for short-term scheduling and long-term investment planning of storage power plants for 30-year long planning horizon. The proposed methodology is applied to cost-benefit analysis of stand-alone storage plants operating under market conditions through price arbitrage: pumped hydropower plant and hydrogen storage plant.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a comprehensive design of a renewable hydrogen powered microgrid that can provide backup power to a community in Cornwall, Ontario when disconnected from the power grid. The work employs the implementation of the energy hub concept to optimally design and operate energy generation systems to meet energy loads of a community. Solar PVs, wind turbines, electrolysers, hydrogen tanks, fuel cells and fuel cell vehicles are considered as the components that make up the entire system providing energy within the community. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is done to assess the safety of hydrogen based microgrid. The major load centers include a fresh food distribution center and a residential complex, where the peak demand is ∼5410 kW. The results of a mixed integer linear programming optimization problem show that a renewable energy generation system size of 2000 kW (400 kW-solar Photovoltaic and 1600 kW-wind turbine) is required. In addition to this, a backup fuel cell generation system of 3000 kW is also needed for the two-day blackout period. One of the positive attributes of implementing vehicle to grid services during islanded operation mode is that it enables the community to offset investment in fuel cell backup generation capacity by 1000 kW. Thirty-eight Toyota Mirai have been used to provide the vehicle to grid service. Due to the scale of the system, it is observed that even after proposing the use of existing market pricing mechanisms for the services offered by the microgrid, the energy system does not have a positive net present value at the end of its project life. Therefore, further economic incentives in the form of bundling costs need to be sanctioned for cleaner microgrid energy systems to be developed.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, there has been a growing interest in large-scale use of hydrogen in the transportation and renewable energy sectors. Relatively cost-effective storage options at scale are essential to realize the full potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Underground geologic storage of hydrogen could offer substantial storage cost reductions as well as buffer capacity to meet possible disruptions in supply or changing seasonal demands. Several geologic storage site options are being considered including salt caverns, depleted oil and/or gas reservoirs, aquifers, and hard rock caverns. This paper describes an economic analysis that addresses the costs entailed in developing and operating a geologic storage facility. The analysis focuses on salt caverns to illustrate potential city demand for hydrogen using geostorage options because (1) salt caverns are known to successfully contain hydrogen, and (2) there is more geotechnical certainty involved with salt storage as compared to the other three storage options. The main findings illustrate that geologic limitations rather than city demand cause a larger disparity between costs from one city to the next. For example Detroit hydrogen storage within salt caverns will cost approximately three times more than Los Angeles with its larger population. Detroit is located near thinly bedded salt formations, whereas Los Angeles has access to more massive salt formations. Los Angeles requires the development of larger and fewer caverns and therefore has lower costs. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As a result of the rising share of renewable energy in Germany, suitable energy storage solutions are needed. At the same time, existing base-load lignite-fired power plants suffer from low capacity utilization and frequent load changes. In combination with a Coal-to-Liquids (CTL) facility, the power generation utilization might increase. By using the existing power plant infrastructure, investment costs for the CTL facility can be reduced. Such combined polygeneration concepts, called ’Annex’, have been developed at TU Bergakademie Freiberg. Previously, polygeneration concepts based on Methanol - to - Gasoline (MTG), Methanol - to - Olefins and Fischer - Tropsch synthesis have been analyzed. In addition, the Annex CTL plant can be used to store energy by incorporating renewable hydrogen from electrolysis into the synthesis step. Such a concept offers the advantage to lower CO2 emissions and could be used to store renewable excess power. In the current study, concepts based on entrained-flow gasification and MTG synthesis are analyzed. This concept is compared to a stand-alone synthesis route. Linking a 52 MWel alkaline water electrolysis to the synthesis plant, hydrogen can be integrated in the CTL plant. Four different concepts for hydrogen integration are investigated. Fluctuations in hydrogen supply could be counter-balanced through storage tanks or Demand Side Management in the CTL Annex plant. A techno-economic study is conducted using the commercial software package Aspen Plus. An analysis of efficiencies, carbon emissions and production costs is provided.

	abstract = {Limited dispatchability of wind parks and unexpected grid power injections create unbalances between the generated electric power and the actual required power that has to be reduced for proper operation of the electrical grid. The increasing amount of renewable energy sources stresses this problem in several countries, where the responses in terms of reinforcement of transmission lines and ancillary services are not sufficiently fast or effective. In this study, we analyze the potential of a grid balancing system based on different combinations of traditional gas turbine based power plants with innovative 'power-to-gas' plants. Power-to-gas is a promising solution to balance the electric grid, based on water electrolysis, which can effectively contribute to reducing the uncertainty of dispatch plans. According to this system, the excess power produced by renewables is converted into hydrogen, which can be then injected into the natural gas grid. Different economic scenarios are assessed in this work, leading to a set of optimal sizes of the proposed system, using a statistical approach in order to estimate wind farm productivity and forecasting errors, as well as each component load conditions. Economic parameters, equivalent operating hours, CO2 emissions and lost wind energy are the main performances indexes considered in this work to compare gas turbine and electrolysis balancing systems. From an economic point of view, hybrid systems including both balancing technologies generally lead to the best performances. The scenario which leads to the highest power-to-gas capacity (with installed electrolysis power of about 6% of wind park nominal power) is determined coupling a mid-term perspective of reduction in investment costs with favorable energy market conditions or with incentives ("green-gas" or carbon taxes). In such conditions, an equivalence between the two technologies in terms of optimum installed power can be reached at an electricity-to-natural gas cost ratio between 1.8 and 2. In most interesting scenarios, the P2G system brings about a lower total wind electricity injected in the grid, due to wind-to-gas energy conversion, while it allows reducing energy losses due to grid congestion and curtailment of the wind park; however, the additional CO2 emissions due to gas turbines operation and due to the reduced electricity production tend to offset or to limit the positive effect of the carbon-free gas production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {To decrease the use of fossil fuels and face the energetic demand, the integration of renewable energy is a necessary step. Part of this renewable energy can be supplied by the production of electricity from photovoltaic panels and windfarms. The massive use of these intermittent energies will lead to overproduction periods, and there is consequently a need to convert this surplus of electricity into a storable form of energy. Power-to-gas (PtG) technology consists in using electricity to convert water into hydrogen by electrolysis, and then to synthetize methane from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Techno-economic and Life Cycle Assessment of methane production via the combination of anaerobic digestion and PtG technology have been applied to sewage sludge valorization. Process studies and equipment design have been addressed considering already available technologies. Sensitivity analyses have been done on biogas upgrading technologies, electricity prices, annual operation time and composition of the electricity mix with also a comparison between PtG and direct injection. It appears that the more the electricity is expensive, the longer the operation time of the methanation process must be to be competitive with injection of methane from biogas. Reduction of electricity consumption of the electrolysis step decreases production costs. Even if the current context does not feature adapted conditions to ensure an economically viable chain, the evolution of the energetic context in the next few years as well as the expected technological improvements will contribute to overall cost reduction. From an environmental point of view, continuous PtG generates more greenhouse gases than direct injection, but intermittent operation with use of renewable electricity can significantly reduce GHG emissions. From an endpoint impacts perspective, impact from continuous PtG are higher than biogas upgrading, but much lower than fossil energy. Future development of low electricity consumption of the electrolysis process, and integration of renewable credits from CO2valorization can increase the competitiveness of this technology. © 2016},

The conversion of electricity to hydrogen via ELY is often called “power to gas”, while transforming hydrogen to electricity via FC is referred to as re-electrification. The application of these technologies currently faces high costs and finding a positive business case is challenging. This study quantifies the economic potential of marketing FC/ELY systems’ flexibility. Their potential to reduce wind farm forecast errors as well as the system's ability to provide secondary control reserve (SCR) in Germany is investigated. For this purpose, data for the year 2013 is used. Different root mean squared errors and a probability density function (PDF) for forecast errors are considered. SCR dispatch power in high temporal resolution is approximated and different bidding strategies (SCR market) are taken into account. Results show that both applications can be economically viable, also when being combined. However, profitability is highly dependent on the system's configuration as well as its operating strategy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The necessary heating for the bioethanol reforming reaction can be provided by the renewable sources to enhance the efficiency of the hydrogen production.

We investigate in this paper the interest of a hybrid solar energy system, including a lithium-based batteries bank and a hydrogen chain (electrolyser, gas storages and fuel cell), for an off-grid application. This system is compared with two reference cases: PV-diesel generator and PV-Batteries. These different systems have been represented using empirical and semi-empirical models and are simulated with the CEA made ODYSSEY platform. The originality of our study lies in the simultaneous optimisation of the power management strategy and the components' size, and in the detailed modelling of the components (power consumption of the auxiliaries and ageing approach in the form of performances degradation). The PV-Batteries-H2 system is operated by an efficient power management strategy and its optimal sizing is assessed on the basis of technical (e.g. load satisfaction) and economic (e.g. levelized cost of electricity) criteria. The results highlight the important role of the hydrogen chain in reducing the cost of the supplied energy. It is also shown that performances degradation of the hydrogen chain has a limited impact on the system optimal sizing and economic results. © 2014 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {A viable hydrogen infrastructure is one of the main challenges for fuel cells in mobile applications. Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or cavern storage since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the investment costs of liquefaction plants. A well-to-wheel analysis indicates that all investigated pathways have less than 30% GHG-emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel pathways within a European framework. © 2017 The Authors},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel control strategy for the optimal management of microgrids with high penetration of renewable energy sources and different energy storage systems. The control strategy is based on the integration of optimal generation scheduling with a model predictive control in order to achieve both long and short-term optimal planning. In particular, long-term optimization of the various microgrid components is obtained by the adoption of an optimal generation scheduling, in which a statistical approach is used to take into account weather and load forecasting uncertainties. The real-time management of the microgrid is instead entrusted to a model predictive controller, which has the important feature of using the results obtained by the optimal generation scheduling. The proposed control strategy was tested in a laboratory-scale microgrid present at the University of Seville, which is composed of an electronic power source that emulates a photovoltaic system, a battery bank and a hydrogen production and storage system. Two different experimental tests that simulate a summer and a winter day were carried out over a 24-h period to verify the reliability and performance enhancement of the control system. Results show an effective improvement in performance in terms of reduction of the microgrid operating cost and greater involvement of the hydrogen storage system for the maintenance of a spinning reserve in batteries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Power-to-Substitute-Natural-Gas (SNG) processes are studied since they can offer solutions for renewable energy storage and transportation. In the present study, an original Power-to-SNG process combining high-temperature steam electrolysis and CO2 methanation is economically assessed. This evaluation is based on experimental data describing the electrolyser performance and its degradation during long-term operation. These data are obtained on a commercial single cell. Tests are originally conducted by imposing voltage and steam conversion rate. The main conclusions of this experimental work are that two fields of current density evolution are evidenced in the tested conditions: a first transient one where the current density absolute value decreases very quickly, followed by a second field where the evolution of current density achieves a steady state. The influence of the operating point seems not significant once this state is achieved. The process assessed here has been developed in a previous work where a precise framework matching with a wide range of applications was defined. The design of the process main units and the calculation of matter and energy fluxes are based on this work. To go further, the economic assessment of this process is proposed. In this study, various scenarios of initial performance of the electrolyser are considered and integrate the performance degradation associated. The SNG production cost is estimated between 211 and 570 €/MWhHHV according to the scenario and the hypotheses considered. The two major items accounting for this high cost are the purchase cost of the electrolyser and its performance degradation. It also evidenced that none of the other items can be neglected. Through a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that an increase of plant annual availability and capacity makes the SNG production cost decrease. Copyright © 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Such ‘Energy Hubs’ have the potential to provide a unique future integrated system to meet consumer's energy demands utilizing conversion and storage technologies for multiple energy carriers such as electricity and hydrogen. Storing hydrogen in the natural gas pipeline network is an effective factor in reducing the cost of clean power produced. Wind turbines, solar farms, and CCPPs act as energy generation and transformation components within an energy hub. Maximizing revenues from selling power and from emissions credits represent the objective function; whereas hydrogen percentage in CCPP fuel represents the decision variable. Meeting power demand and hydrogen limits in CCPP fuel are the most effective constraints. GAMS is used to model energy hub costs to approach the problem using mathematical programming while power cost and emission credits represent the model outputs. Such a model will aid in sizing of the key components within the hub and optimizing its operation. Hydrogen production cost is found to be an average of $4.10 per kg representing an extra cost while reducing CO2 and NOx emissions by about 2%. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Cost-effective materials for electrocatalytic water splitting are key to renewable energy research. In this work, MoS2/sulfur and nitrogen co-doped reduced graphene oxide (SNG) nanocomposite was produced via a two-step hydrothermal process. The formation of nanocomposite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is found that the MoS2/SNG nanocomposite exhibits much higher catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) relative to MoS2 and MoS2/RGO catalysts, as manifested by much larger cathodic current density with smaller overpotential of -120 mV and lower Tafel slope of 45 mV dec-1. It is believed that the outstanding performance is attributed to the high electronic conductivity of SNG for fast charge transport. This study highlights the significance of the strong electronic coupling effect between the MoS2 and SNG in the enhancement of HER electrocatalytic activity. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Using fueling and power demand data from an existing public hydrogen station in Irvine, California, dynamic analyses of the self-sustainable station have been carried out. Various control strategies are developed and evaluated to determine the impacts of control strategies and renewable capacity factors on the efficiency and other performance characteristics of the station. The simulation results and analysis suggest that with careful sizing and system design, a self-sustainable hydrogen fueling station that relies completely upon renewable sources for hydrogen production, storage and dispensing is feasible. Moreover, a cost and sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the levelized hydrogen cost for different station designs. The cost of the hydrogen is determined to be as low as $6.71 per kg or $9.14 per kg when the station is powered by 200 kW of wind turbines or 360 kW of PV arrays, respectively.

	abstract = {This paper aims to present a thermo-economic approach for methanol production comparing different renewable energy sources. In this study, the methanol is produced from the CO2 hydrogenation in a pressurized reactor; two different plant configurations are analyzed: in the first carbon dioxide is obtained from biogas upgrade, while in the second one CO2 is acquired from external sources. Carbon dioxide is mixed with hydrogen and then the gas is sent into the reactor for methanol synthesis. Hydrogen is produced by an alkaline pressurized electrolyzer (1 MW, 30 bar) fed by time-dependent electrical energy produced by renewable plants (hydroelectric, wind or photovoltaic), when available; in the remaining periods, electricity is purchased by the national grid. Since the available electrical energy from the different renewable sources is not constant throughout the year, a time-dependent hierarchical thermo-economic analysis is performed in order to investigate the best plant configuration. The analyses are performed with the W-ECoMP simulation tool (developed by the authors' research group) considering different costs of electricity and different methanol selling prices taking into account the future market forecast. The results for the two plant lay-outs are compared from energetic, economic and environmental point of view for the different renewable energy sources to evaluate the best solution in the Italian scenario. © 2015 Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.},

In this work, we report Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3−δ (BSCF) on nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon (NC) as a novel and highly-active bi-functional catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The NC is prepared using organic waste, namely banana peels. The carbonization, heteroatom doping, and surface functionalization are achieved simultaneously during a facile synthesis process. The obtained NC is characterized by large mesopores with a specific surface area of 457.6 m2 g−1. The electrochemical measurements reveal that, the current density of the BSCF/NC in 0.1 mol L−1 KOH reaches −3 mA cm−2 at 0.74 V and 10 mA cm−2 at 1.58 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. Furthermore, the hybrid shows a smaller onset potential and larger current density towards both ORR and OER in comparison to composites made of BSCF and common commercial carbon supports, including acetylene black (AB) carbon, activated carbon (AC), and Vulcan XC-72 carbon. Besides enhancing the surface area and the dispersion of BSCF, the electronic interaction between BSCF and NC likely renders the enhanced activity. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This evaluation is based on electrolyzer performance during long-term operation at large-scales, with datasheets from previous studies where a specific framework for hydrogen energy storage and electric grid load balancing matching with the Spanish power system was thoroughly defined. To go further, mass and energy balances, preliminary design of main unit processes, as well as efficiencies, costs and impact potentials are investigated in this study. It proves the feasibility for power management using gas storage, while reducing conventional capacity, with high utilization of technologies and increasing the contributions of renewable energies, at the same time that producing clean fuels for the hydrogen economy. The cumulative efficiency is mainly caped by the electrolytic processes, whereas the methanation steps remove all material issues related to transport by pipelines or end-use applications. The production costs of hydrogen, methane and electricity are estimated in 0.5 €/kgH, 0.26 €/Nm3SNG and 51 €/MWhe, considering a zero price for ‘surplus energy’ and future costs of the components; electrolysis accounts for 60% of total expenses, methanation 30% and re-electrification 10%, while the primary energy price becomes dominant (e.g., 25 €/MWhe translates to 133 €/MWhe of regenerated power) due to the low global energy yield (30.8%). Finally, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (35 gCO/kWhe) are low as far as the primary input is mainly surplus renewable energy and processes are basically cyclic. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The method allows a system components sizing for any hydrogen fraction in the HCNG fuel. Case studies are carried out to verify the relevance and effectiveness of this method.

Although hydrogen and its application in fuel cell is considered as a high-cost energy system, some cost-efficient solutions have been found for their use in stand-alone applications, which usually depend on the variability of renewable sources that have to be oversized in order to reduce their dependence on external energy sources. This paper shows the results from the simulation of several alternatives of introducing hydrogen technologies to increase the independence of a remote-telecom application fed by photovoltaic panels. Hydrogen is obtained by electrolysis and it is used in a fuel cell when the renewable energy source is not enough to maintain the stand-alone application. TRNSYS simulation environment has been used for evaluating the proposed alternatives.

The Royal Government of Bhutan has published plans to provide electricity to all households in the next 20 years, but the practical problems of extending the grid over long distances and mountainous terrain will make that target difficult and expensive to achieve. Consequently, the possibility of using natural energy and diversified generation is attractive. This paper examines the use of hydro power in one community and photovoltaics with wind power in another. Hydrogen is the proposed energy storage medium in both cases. Analysis suggests that it is technically possible to use renewable energy and hydrogen for diversified power supplies and that where, as here, the costs of grid extension are high, it may also be financially viable. Thus we argue that there is a good case for establishing a test and demonstration system near the capital Thimphu for further investigation prior to use in remote locations. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

In this context, the aim of the present study is to carry out both an economic and environmental analysis of a start-up RWE plant using a simulation code developed in previous work [1] and a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The plant will be located in the South of Italy (Puglia) and will consist of different RWE sources (Wind Power, Photovoltaic, Biomass). RWE will be used to produce hydrogen from an electrolyzer, which will feed a fleet of buses using different fuels (methane, hydrogen, or a mixture of these). In particular, a wind turbine of 850 kW will feed a hydrogen production plant and a biomass plant will produce methane. Preliminary studies have shown that it is possible to obtain hydrogen at a competitive cost (DOE target) and that components (wind turbine, electrolyzer, vessel, etc.) influence the final price. In addition, LCA results have permitted a comparison of different minibuses using either fossil fuels or renewable energy sources. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Professor T.

	abstract = {The potential future use of hydrogen as an energy carrier in the transportation sector necessitates a shift in the current energy supply chain from supplying petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel, to supply hydrogen. This research was carried out to investigate hydrogen demand and determine the optimum hydrogen delivery network employing truck transportation. Peninsular Malaysia was taken as a case study. The hydrogen demand was determined using two method: Firstly, by assuming that the hydrogen demand in Peninsular Malaysia as a function of total vehicle numbers, average total distance traveled and vehicle fuel economy were measured. While the second method investigated based on the current supply of gasoline and diesel from surveys on local petrol stations in Peninsular Malaysia. As a result, the second method was found as more accurate method and adopted as the overall energy demand in Peninsular Malaysia. Objective function for total investment cost for the future hydrogen infrastructure was developed based on the production technologies, type of transport, type of storage, product phase and plant type. The model was solved based on MILP using GAMS. Finally from the result, it can be concluded that liquefied hydrogen produced by natural gas steam reforming and delivered via tanker trucks is the optimum hydrogen supply chain method due to the minimum cost. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

It considers four illustrative cases: a high (1000 EJ) and a low (300 EJ) energy future, and for each of these conditions, a high (80%) and low (20%) fossil fuel energy share. We argue that neither high energy future is probable, because of resource limitations, and rising energy, environmental and money costs per unit of delivered energy as annual energy demand rises far beyond present levels. The low energy/low fossil case is most likely, followed by the low energy/high fossil case, although both require large cuts in energy use, and most probably, lifestyle changes in high energy use countries. Hydrogen production would be best favoured in the low fossil fuel options, with production both greater, and implemented earlier, in the higher energy case. It is thus least likely in the low energy/high fossil fuel case. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {In this paper hydrogen generation and storage systems optimization, related to a very large size hydraulic plant (Itaipu, 14 GW) in South America, is investigated using an original multilevel thermo-economic optimization approach developed by the Authors. Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis employing time-dependent hydraulic energy related to the water which is not normally used by the plant, named "spilled water". From a thermo-economic point of view, the two main aspects of the study are the optimal definition of the plant size and the whole system management. Both of them are strongly influenced by (i) spilled water energy variability related to its time-dependent distribution during the whole year, (ii) time-dependent electricity demand of Paraguay and Brazil (the owners of the Itaipu plant) electrical grids, and (iii) the hydrogen demand profile. The system analyzed here consists of a very large size hydrogen generation plant (hundreds of MW) based on pressurised water electrolysers fed with the so called "spilled water electricity", the related H 2 storage, and the H 2 demand profile for Paraguay transport sector utilization. Since H 2 plant optimal size is strongly correlated to optimal management and vice-versa, in this paper two hierarchical levels have been considered hour by hour on a complete year time period, in order to minimize capital and variable costs. This time period analysis is necessary to properly take into account spilled energy variability to find out H 2 production system optimal size, optimal storage solution and best economical results. For the optimal storage size, two different solutions have been carefully investigated: (i) classical long time H 2 physical storage using pressurised tanks at 200 bar; (ii) hybrid one using reduced size physical storage (one day time demand) where the energy to feed electrolysers is taken from electrical grid when spilled water energy is not available [Rivarolo M, Bogarin J, Magistri L, Massardo AF. Hydrogen generation with large size renewable plants: the Itaipu 14 GW hydraulic plant case. In: 3rd international conference of applied energy (ICAE), 16-18 May 2011, Perugia; 2011.]. For both the two solutions, time-dependent results are presented and discussed with particular emphasis to economic aspects, system size, capital costs and related investments. It is worthy to note that the results reported here for this particular H 2 large size plant case represent a general methodology, since it is applicable to different size, primary renewable energy, plant location, and different H 2 utilization. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The major reason for this is that the costs of hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles are still very high.

Hence, much less bio-hydrogen is wasted, so the cost of generating electricity using the fuel cell is lower.

	abstract = {Renewable energy is one of the possible solutions when addressing climate change. Today, large-scale renewable energy integration needs to include the experience to balance the discrepancy between electricity demand and supply. The electrification of transportation may have the potential to deal with this imbalance and to reduce its high dependence on oil production. For this reason, it is interesting to analyse the extent to which transport electrification can further the renewable energy integration. This paper quantifies this issue in Inner Mongolia, where the share of wind power in the electricity supply was 6.5% in 2009 and which has the plan to develop large-scale wind power. The results show that electric vehicles (EVs) have the ability to balance the electricity demand and supply and to further the wind power integration. In the best case, the energy system with EV can increase wind power integration by 8%. The application of EVs benefits from saving both energy system cost and fuel cost. However, the negative consequences of decreasing energy system efficiency and increasing the CO2 emission should be noted when applying the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV). The results also indicate that developing renewable energy is crucial for transportation electrification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the political, economic and environmental impacts of producing hydrogen from biomass. Hydrogen is a promising renewable fuel for transportation and domestic applications. Hydrogen is a secondary form of energy that has to be manufactured like electricity. The promise of hydrogen as an energy carrier that can provide pollution-free, carbon-free power and fuels for buildings, industry, and transport makes it a potentially critical player in our energy future. Currently, most hydrogen is derived from non-renewable resources by steam reforming in which fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, but could in principle be generated from renewable resources such as biomass by gasification. Hydrogen production from fossil fuels is not renewable and produces at least the same amount of CO2 as the direct combustion of the fossil fuel. The production of hydrogen from biomass has several advantages compared to that of fossil fuels. The major problem in utilization of hydrogen gas as a fuel is its unavailability in nature and the need for inexpensive production methods. Hydrogen production using steam reforming methane is the most economical method among the current commercial processes. These processes use non-renewable energy sources to produce hydrogen and are not sustainable. It is believed that in the future biomass can become an important sustainable source of hydrogen. Several studies have shown that the cost of producing hydrogen from biomass is strongly dependent on the cost of the feedstock. Biomass, in particular, could be a low-cost option for some countries. Therefore, a cost-effective energy-production process could be achieved in which agricultural wastes and various other biomasses are recycled to produce hydrogen economically. Policy interest in moving towards a hydrogen-based economy is rising, largely because converting hydrogen into useable energy can be more efficient than fossil fuels and has the virtue of only producing water as the by-product of the process. Achieving large-scale changes to develop a sustained hydrogen economy requires a large amount of planning and cooperation at national and international alike levels. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

LH2 with its high volumetric energy density and, compared with compressed hydrogen, increased operational safety is a prime energy carrier for large scale stationary energy storage. But balancing load or supply fluctuations from seconds to several hours with hydrogen alone is difficult due to the response times of the flow control, and an additional short-term electrical energy storage will be needed. For this purpose a compact LIQHYSMES Storage Unit is proposed which integrates the H2 liquefaction part, the LH2 tank and the SMES based on Magnesium Diboride and cooled by the LH2 bath. This allows jointly utilizing the cryogenic infrastructure and reducing the otherwise significant H2 liquefaction losses by introducing a novel process with "cold recovery".

	abstract = {The claim of catastrophic man made climate change or global warming through anthropogenic CO2 has presently focused the interest on the tailpipe emissions of CO2 per km, with recent legislations obsessively targeting these emissions of CO2 with defectively implemented procedures. With a variety of different propulsion solutions (electric, hybrid electric, hybrid mechanic, conventional) and different fuels (Diesel, Petrol, alternative fossil, alternative renewable) available in the near future, a more comprehensive approach based on the full fuel cycle, and eventually also the full life cycle of the vehicle appear to be necessary. The paper is a contribution to trigger further improvement to currently implemented procedures. The paper discusses the CO2 emission data in the present form, some simple but effective measures to improve the accuracy of the data collection procedure, and propose results of fuel cycle CO2-e analysis of vehicles with electric and thermal engines having different fuels. Vehicles with advanced internal combustion engines and power trains fuelled with Diesel may reach CO2-e values of 100 g/km in Australia. Use of bio-ethanol in these vehicles may deliver in Australia a significant reduction of CO 2-e emissions to values below 36 g/km. Emission factors for Victoria are presently 1.23 kg CO2-e/kWh for the purchased electricity and vehicles powered by electric motors will need a significant reduction of this indirect CO2-e emission to become competitive. Values below 0.5 kg CO 2-e/kWh are needed to make electric cars competitive with Diesel cars while values below 0.1 kg CO2-e/kWh are needed to make electric cars competitive with bio-ethanol cars. Compared with all these alternatives, renewable hydrogen may possibly compete with Diesel when produced with renewable energy sources and made available at the pump for less than 0.1 kg CO 2-e/MJ of fuel energy, and with bio-ethanol if produced and distributed at a cost below 0.02 kg CO2-e/MJ of fuel energy. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In order to analyze the costs on a unified basis, they are updated to a common year (2009), taking into account the yearly inflation rates. The study also considers whether the hydrogen has been produced in centralized or distributed facilities. From these data, the expected future costs for conventional production of hydrogen are calculated considering several scenarios on carbon emission taxations. Based on these estimations, together with the predicted future costs (2019-2020 and 2030) for hydrogen from alternative sources, several hydrogen cost-parity analyses are exposed for renewable and nuclear energies. From the comparison between these alternative technologies for hydrogen production and the conventional ones (steam methane reforming and coal gasification), several predictions on the time-periods to reach cost parities are elaborated. © 2010 Professor T.

	abstract = {The work concerns the optimisation of hydrogen production by electrolysis using renewable energy resources. To achieve this aim, the techno-economic analysis was dedicated to a system composed of PV panels and an electrolyser, including all associated technology such as the chopper circuit1. The first step was to complete a LabVIEW simulation program which was able to reproduce a photovoltaic (PV) plant connected to the alkaline electrolyser. The virtual instrument was developed on the basis of the models of incident radiation, PV cells and electrolyser. After the indication of PV cell type and number, tilt of all panels, number of strings2, latitude and main characteristics of the electrolyser (e.g. nominal power, number of electrolytic cells, working temperature and pressure), the program computes the hydrogen produced, the electrolyser running hours and other data, for a chosen period of the year. Differently tilted photovoltaic panels were considered either directly coupled with the electrolyser or connected via a DC converter between the two systems. The simulation program, called "RenHydrogen", provides a qualitative calculation of the hydrogen production during the whole year, comparing different technological options and leading to the techno-economic optimisation of the PV-electrolysis system. © 2010 Professor T.

	abstract = {This paper investigates large scale bio-methane generation from renewable sources, mixing hydrogen produced by water electrolysis and syngas obtained by pressurized oxygen blown biomass gasification. Hydrogen is produced by water electrolysis employing time-dependent hydraulic energy related to the water which is not normally used by the plant, named "spilled water electricity". The oxygen, also obtained in the electrolysis process, is employed for biomass gasification to produce syngas: after purification treatments, the syngas is mixed with hydrogen in a chemical reactor to obtain bio-methane. The whole process is optimized here using two different thermo-economic approaches: (i) for the design point analysis of the chemical and thermodynamic significant parameters in electrolysis, gasification, syngas purification and methanation processes; (ii) for an entire one-year time-dependent analysis in order to define the optimal plant size, since the spilled energy and the electrical grid load vary widely throughout the day and the year. The hydrogen generation plant is based on 1 MWe water electrolysers using the "spilled water electricity", when available; in the remaining periods, in order to assure a regular H2 production, the energy is taken from the electrical grid, but at a higher cost. It is worth noting that the methane produced, named bio-methane, is totally "CO 2 free", since it is produced from renewable sources only. Moreover, the optimization method presented here has a general value, thus it can be easily applied to different sizes, economic scenarios and plant locations.

The calculation of power price fluctuations is based on a parameterization of existing data on wind power production, power consumption and power price evolution in the West Danish power market area. The price for hydrogen is derived as a function of the optimal electrolyzer operation hours per year for four different wind penetration scenarios. It is found to amount to 0.41-0.45 €/Nm3.

Its clean burning characteristics help to meet the stringent emission norms. Majority of the work using hydrogen as a fuel is being done in spark ignition engine, however, in this experimental investigation efforts have been made to utilize it in compression ignition engine. In this investigation, the performance and emission characteristics were studied on a direct injection, single cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled, stationary diesel engine coupled to an electric dynamometer. Hydrogen-enriched air with carburetion technique was used as intake charge in the above mentioned engine with 10% & 20% exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). Performance parameters such as specific energy consumption, brake specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency were determined and emissions such as oxides of nitrogen, unburned hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen and exhaust gas temperature were measured. Dual fuel operation with hydrogen induction coupled with exhaust gas recirculation results in lowered emission level and improved performance level compared to the case of neat diesel operation. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The application of this procedure to four 75 W PV modules directly coupled to five 50 W PEM electrolyser stacks (250 W in total) predicts an energy transfer of over 94% of the theoretical maximum. Initial experiments indicate an actual energy transfer of around 95%.

	abstract = {The effective promotion of hydrogen technologies is best achieved when there is a strategy and a well defined and accepted plan for a hydrogen-based economy. The HYRREG project, funded by the Program of Cooperation of Southwest Europe (SUDOE), had as main objectives the development of a platform to generate hydrogen-related projects and a roadmap to enhance regional competitiveness and development of industry in this field in the SUDOE region which accounts for approximately 18% of the area and 12% of the population of the European Union. An analysis of the energy profiles in these regions reveals significant growth in capacity of renewable sources, principally from wind energy, yet the region has a high dependence on fossil fuels. The HYRREG consortium therefore believes that there is a good basis for supporting the development and introduction of hydrogen-based technologies in the region, especially with respect to the use of hydrogen for storage, to enhance security of supply and pave the way for a cleaner environment. The measures undertaken, in the form of platform activities and the preparation of a roadmap, were designed to increase collaboration between different institutions, at both national and international levels, and to raise awareness in society of the benefits of using such technologies. An online database of technologies and product opportunities in SUDOE and across Europe, as well as yearly catalogues listing profiles of companies or institutions working on hydrogen and fuel cells, their research lines and fields of interest and also including technology transfer profiles highlighting technologies offered and those sought in the region, were prepared to help companies in the region to access international markets and as an aid to establish links between entities. The SUDOE roadmap is mainly based on a qualitative analysis, focused on stakeholder preferences and region specific conditions, such as availability of resources as well as the characteristics of the current and future energy systems in the region. Several enquiries were conducted to systematically examine each component of the different hydrogen chains selected by the regions of France, Portugal and Spain. This exercise contributed to the identification of first user centres in the SUDOE region. The project concluded that hydrogen will play an important role in the energy context of SUDOE, namely in the transport sector, and its production will rely mainly on renewable energies - wind and solar being in the forefront. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {For an energy supply chain based on liquefied hydrogen, low parasitic energy consumption throughout the chain, from conversion to end-use, is a prerequisite for competitiveness with other energy carriers. The viability of the chain from the viewpoint of efficiency and cost is to a large extent dependent on the efficiency of the liquefier, which is the dominant power-consuming process in the chain. Hence, an innovative large-scale, high-efficiency hydrogen liquefier based on mixed-refrigerant (MR) pre-cooling has been developed. The liquefier employs MR pre-cooling down to a hydrogen temperature of 75 K while below this temperature, a reversed helium/neon Brayton cycle provides the requisite cooling. Two MR-based liquefier models have been derived. In the first, Joule-Thomson throttling valves are employed for MR expansion, while these have been replaced with liquid expanders in the second. With 21 bar hydrogen feed pressure and an ambient temperature of 300 K, the resulting figures for specific liquefaction power are 6.48 and 6 . 15 kWh / kgLH2, respectively.

	abstract = {Hydrogen production from water using the sulfur-iodine (S-I) thermochemical cycle, powered by combined solar and fossil heat sources, has been investigated. This combined energy supply was conceived in order to operate the chemical process continuously: a solar concentrator plant with a large-scale heat storage supplies thermal load for services at medium temperatures (< 550 {ring operator} C), while a fossil fuel furnace provides heat load at higher temperatures. Additionally, a methanol production plant fed with the carbon oxides generated from fossil fuel combustion was included. Since the sulfuric acid concentration/decomposition section is interfaced to both the fossil furnace and the solar plant, it was studied more exhaustively. Results obtained show that the major part of the total energy demand (ca. 70%) is renewable. An industrial scale plant with hydrogen capacity of ca. 26,000 tons/year coupled with a 267 MWth solar plant was considered, and the specific cost of the produced hydrogen and methanol determined. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

The variability of wind power production was handled by varying the hydropower production and the production on CHP plants using biomass, by power transmission, by varying the heat production in heat pumps and electric heat boilers, and by varying the production of hydrogen in electrolysis plants in combination with hydrogen storage. Investment in hydrogen storage capacity corresponded to 1.2% of annual wind power production in the scenarios without a hydrogen demand from the transport sector, and approximately 4% in the scenarios with a hydrogen demand from the transport sector. Even the scenarios without a demand for hydrogen from the transport sector saw investments in hydrogen storage due to the need for flexibility provided by the ability to store hydrogen. The storage capacities of the electricity storages provided by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles were too small to make hydrogen storage superfluous. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) is one of power generation technologies having the highest potential for carbon capture with low penalties in efficiency and cost. This paper assesses from technical point of view the transformation, through gasification, of coal with or without addition of renewable energy sources or solid waste into decarbonised energy vectors (power, hydrogen) simultaneous with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Investigated plant concepts produce a flexible ratio of power and hydrogen in the range of 400 MW electricity and 0-200 MW hydrogen with 90% carbon capture rate.

	abstract = {Hydrogen as a clean energy carrier is frequently identified as a major solution to the environmental problem of greenhouse gases, resulting from worldwide dependence on fossil fuels. However, most of the world's hydrogen (about 96%) is currently produced from fossil fuels, which does not address the issue of greenhouse gases. Although there is a large motivation of the "hydrogen economy", for improvement of urban air quality, energy security, and integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, CO2 free energy sources are critical to hydrogen becoming a significant energy carrier. Two technologies, applied in tandem, have a promising potential to generate hydrogen without leading to greenhouse gas emissions: 1) electrolysis and 2) thermochemical decomposition of water. This paper will investigate their unique complementary roles to reduce costs of hydrogen production. Together they have a unique potential to serve both de-centralized hydrogen needs in periods of low-demand electricity, and centralized base-load production from a nuclear station. Thermochemical methods have a significantly higher thermal efficiency, but electrolysis can take advantage of low electricity prices during off-peak hours, as well as intermittent and de-centralized supplies like wind, solar or tidal power. By effectively linking these systems, water-based production of hydrogen can become more competitive against the predominant existing technology, SMR (steam-methane reforming). © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {The dependence of road transportation from fossil fuels and the related economic and environmental consequences imposes the diversification of energy sources. Hydrogen can strongly contribute to this goal because it can be produced from different renewable energy sources. In order to boost the development of hydrogen technology and reduce the dependence from conventional fossil fuels, hydrogen can be used in internal combustion engines added to natural gas (NG). Hydrogen-natural gas blends, commonly named HCNG, can be distributed using the natural gas infrastructures without significant modifications if hydrogen content is lower than 30% in volume. In this paper a numerical model has been developed to predict the performance and emissions of an internal combustion engine fuelled by natural gas and hydrogen - natural gas blends. The analysis displayed the impact of hydrogen addition on engine brake efficiency and NOx emission. Stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio was considered for each fuel in order to assure an efficient exhaust after-treatment adopting a three-way catalyst. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was investigated with the aim at improving engine efficiency and reducing NOx emissions respect to undiluted charge. In fact, HCNG blends combustion properties are particularly suitable for EGR, assuring a stable combustion also when the charge is diluted. Maximum brake torque (MBT) ignition timing has been adopted for all fuels and operating conditions investigated. Simulations were performed at conditions reproducing engine operation on a passenger car over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). Results were displayed in terms of fuel consumption in MJ/km and NOx emissions in g/km. The results showed that HCNG blends improved engine brake efficiency, particularly at low loads and for the highest hydrogen content, with fuel consumptions on energy basis over NEDC 2.5%, 4.7% and 5.7% lower than CNG, for HCNG 10, 20 and 30 respectively. NOx emissions increased of about 4% for HCNG 10, 11% for HCNG 20 and 20% for HCNG 30, due to the higher in-cylinder gas temperatures. Further investigations, performed adopting 10% EGR for HCNG blends, showed a large reduction of NOx emission, over 80% compared with natural gas (without EGR), with a positive effect also on engine efficiency. The decrease in fuel consumption using HCNG blends together with EGR, compared with natural gas, was 5.4%, 6.6% and 7.7% for HCNG 10, 20 and 30, respectively. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {The intermittent nature of most Renewable Energy Sources (RES) imposes difficulties in matching supply with demand and technical problems associated with weak grids. Energy storage may play a vital role in addressing these issues allowing for higher penetration of RES into weak electricity grids, especially in islands and isolated communities. The aim of STORIES project, which is co-financed by the Intelligent Energy - Europe programme of the European Commission, is to provide suggestions for changes in policies and regulations covering RES installations and to promote the use of energy storage technologies in island grids based also on the assessment of economic aspects, such as internal and external costs of energy storage solutions in order to increase RES penetration. The main outcome of the project will be the development of a Roadmap for the promotion of hybrid RES-energy storage power systems, which may assist in overcoming barriers for higher RES penetration in European islands and boosting the respective RES electricity markets in these areas. In the present work, the introduction of hydrogen as a storage means and wind energy as an electricity production source into the power supply system of the Portuguese island Corvo in Azores is presented. A cost-benefit analysis is carried out in order to examine the proposed RES and Hydrogen power system from an economic, environmental and social perspective. The results indicate that a considerable RES penetration into the power system of Corvo island is feasible and entails convergence between the financial and social profitability showing alignment of private and social interest. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Therefore, developing a clean and environmentally friendly energy resource is necessary given the depletion of fossil fuels, the preservation of the earth's ecosystem and self-preservation of human life. Biological hydrogen production, using dark fermentation is being developed as a promising alternative and renewable energy source, using biomass feedstock. In this study, beverage wastewater and agricultural waste were examined as substrates for dark fermentation to produce clean biohydrogen energy. A reference model including all major process steps was computed using the Aspen Plus software program and model valuations were based on the data obtained in our lab and/or a pilot scale process unit. A beverage company in northern Taipei was the source of wastewater used in the production of biological hydrogen, whereby the use of our hydrogen producing system resulted in a maximum annual profit with an annual return rate of approximately 81% with a working volume of 100 m 3 from wastewater and 30% with a working volume of 400 m 3 from agricultural waste using local price evaluation and approximately 60% with working volume of 200 m 3 from wastewater and 39% with working volume of 300 m 3 from agricultural waste. The optimal sizes of the commercial biohydrogen fermenters of wastewater and agriculture waste were 52.51 and 300.57 m 3, respectively which were simulated by local price.

One reactor was a teardrop shaped plastic-film bag reactor, and the other was an acrylic spherical tank reactor. The spherical tank reactor had the best light-focusing properties, with up to a factor of 3.7 increase in the solar energy (and thus hydrogen production) for PEC cells mounted at the optimal point within the reactor electrolyte. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {The need of developing renewable energy to reduce the impact on the global environment and climate change of the increasing industrial development has fostered the use of biological processes to produce biofuel from biohydrogen. The present work made a patent analysis of advanced hydrogen production techniques comparing it with similar prior art in China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the European Union and the United States (U.S.) The aims were to find the scope, competitiveness of prior art, as well as the technology trend on biohydrogen production methods. The patents value was assessed its geographic scope and competitiveness indicators such as green image, low cost, energy efficiency and equipment design. It was found that most of the hydrogen production methods and associated technologies are developed by academic institutions, however their patents are reduced to a local level, and few are patented at international level, which reduces their competitiveness. The China (P.R.C.) is the biggest patent contributor worldwide in terms of hydrogen production methods by academic institutions. Japan is a huge patent contributor, in terms of methods aiming rear-end products application of hydrogen by private companies. The biggest amount of prior art found that the most popular methods of pre-treatment and dark fermentation produced coincide with the time of energetic crisis and the green movement to find alternative fuels. Finally, patent analysis of this study can help to discern the current technology trend and to develop the next generation of biohydrogen processes and associated technologies. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

The commuting ferry is modelled as a H2 ferry, representing the H2 demand. The evaluation includes a grid-connected system and an isolated system with a backup power generator. Simulation results show that much larger components are needed for the isolated system. H2 cost amounted to 2.8 € / kg and 6.2 € / kg for the grid-connected and isolated system, respectively. Sensitivity analyses show that a marginal decrease in wind turbine and electrolyser cost will reduce the H2 cost substantially. Rate of return is also important due to high investment costs.

This analysis is completed in the context of a Hydrogen Economy and competitive electricity markets. The simulation of the operation of a combined nuclear-wind-hydrogen system is discussed first, where the selling and buying of electricity, the selling of excess hydrogen and oxygen, and the selling of heat are optimized to maximize profit to the energy producer. The simulation is performed in two phases: in a pre-dispatch phase, the system model is optimized to obtain optimal hydrogen charge levels for the given operational horizons. In the second phase, a real-time dispatch is carried out on an hourly basis to optimize the operation of the system as to maximize profits, following the hydrogen storage levels of the pre-dispatch phase. Based on the operation planning and dispatch results, an economic evaluation is performed to determine the feasibility of the proposed scheme for investment purposes; this evaluation is based on calculations of modified internal rates of return and net present values for a realistic scenario. The results of the present studies demonstrate the feasibility of a hydrogen storage and production system with oxygen and heat utilization for existent nuclear and wind power generation facilities. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

We re-envision the role of hydrogen at national and international strategic levels, relying entirely on renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is suggested the time for an exclusive 'hydrogen economy' has passed, since electricity and batteries would be used extensively as well. Yet hydrogen would still play a crucial role: in road and rail vehicles requiring a range comparable to today's petrol and diesel vehicles; in coastal and international shipping; in air transport; and for longer-term seasonal storage on electricity grids relying mainly on renewables. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are proposed where medium and long distance trips are required, with plug-in battery electric vehicles reserved for just short trips. A hierarchy of spatially-distributed hydrogen production, storage and distribution centers relying on local renewable energy sources and feedstocks would be created to limit the required hydrogen pipeline network to the main metropolitan areas and regions by complementary use of electricity as a major energy vector. Bulk hydrogen storage would provide the strategic energy reserve to guarantee national and global energy security in a world relying increasingly on renewable energy. It is recommended that this vision next be applied to specific countries by conducting detailed energy-economic-environmental modeling to quantify its net benefits. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {There is an increasing need for new and greater sources of energy for future global transportation applications. One recognized possibility for a renewable, clean source of transportation fuels is solar radiation collected and converted into useable forms of electrical and/or chemical (hydrogen) energy. This paper describes methods for utilizing and combining existing technologies into systems that optimize solar energy collection and conversion into useful transportation fuels. Photovoltaic (PV)-electrolysis (solar hydrogen) and PV-battery charging systems described in this paper overcome inefficiencies inherent in past concepts, where DC power from the PV system was first converted to AC current and then used to power electrical devices at the point of generation, or fed back to the grid to reduce electricity costs. These past, non-optimized concepts included efficiency losses in power conversion and unnecessary costs. These drawbacks can be avoided by capitalizing on the unique feature of solar photovoltaic devices that match their maximum power point to the operating point of an electrolyzer or a battery charger without intervening power transformers. This concept is illustrated for two systems designed, built, and tested by General Motors for fueling a fuel cell electric vehicle and charging an automotive propulsion battery. Based on this research, we propose a scenario in which individual home-owners, businesses, or sites at remote locations with no grid electricity, can capture solar energy, store it as hydrogen generated via water electrolysis, or as electrical energy used to charge storage batteries. Such a decentralized energy system provides a home refueling option for drivers who only travel limited distances each day. © 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

We developed a generic optimization-based model to support the decision-making process for the design of the hydrogen supply chain. The network design problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem to identify the optimal supply chain configurations from various alternatives. The objective is to consider not only cost efficiency, but also safety. Since there is a trade-off between these two objectives, formal multiobjective optimization techniques are required to establish the optimal Pareto solutions that can then be used for decision-making purposes. With the model, the effects of demand uncertainty can be also analyzed by comparing the deterministic and the stochastic solutions. The features and capabilities of the model are illustrated through the application of future hydrogen infrastructure of Korea.

	abstract = {Unitised Regenerative Fuel Cells (URFCs) based on Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology provide a promising opportunity for reducing the cost of the hydrogen subsystem used in renewable-energy hydrogen systems for remote area power supply. A general theoretical relationship between cell potential and current density of a single-cell URFC operating in both fuel-cell and electrolyser modes is derived using the Butler-Volmer equation for both oxygen and hydrogen electrodes, and accounting for membrane resistance and mass transport losses. Modifying the standard Butler-Volmer equation with a denominator term containing two additional 'saturation' parameters to reflect mass transport constraints generates voltage-current curves that are much closer to experimentally obtained polarisation curves in both modes. The theoretical relationship is used to construct a computer model based on Excel and Visual Basic to generate voltage-current curves in both electrolyser and fuel cell modes for URFCs with a range of membrane electrode assembly characteristics. Hence the influence of key factors such as exchange current densities and charge transfer coefficients on cell performance is analysed. Experimental results for voltage-current curves from singe-cell URFCs with a number of different oxygen-side catalysts are reported, and compared to the theoretically modelled curves. Generally values have been found for exchange current densities, charge transfer coefficients, and saturation current densities that give a close fit between the empirical and theoretically generated curves. The values found conform well to expectations based on the catalyst loadings, in partial confirmation of the validity of the modelling approach. The model thus promises to be a useful tool in identifying electrodes with materials and structures, together with optimal catalyst types and loadings that will improve URFC performance. © 2009 Professor T.

	abstract = {Given declining reliance on fossil fuels because of both their greenhouse gas emissions and depletion of reserves, renewable energy (RE) will need to become the main energy form. Most of the technical potential for RE is in intermittently available sources, mainly wind and solar. As penetration from these sources rises, conversion to another energy form, and energy storage, will be needed. Here we assume the energy carrier is hydrogen. This paper examines the consequences for net energy output over time for various rates of growth of wind-hydrogen systems. Wind energy is chosen for this case study because its output is presently far greater than solar, and because its costs are lower. We find that high growth rates of turbine-hydrogen installations lead to 'boom and bust' cycles in both equipment manufacture, and in net energy output. The main reason for these cycles is that such systems have high up-front input energy costs. To avoid these large swings, the rate of installation will have to be cut back, which limits the rate at which energy alternatives can supplant fossil fuels. © 2010, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

So the inclusion of energy vectors (to be produced from several primary resources) in the energy system chain becomes a key concept of the entire human development model. In this new scenario, the opportunity of using hydrogen shows all its interest. Hydrogen, electricity and other energy vectors, in a large scale application, allow to fully satisfy all the final uses of energy that the human society needs for its social and economical development.

	abstract = {To provide and improve national energy security and low-carbon green energy economy, as a government-supported research institute related to developing new and renewable energy technologies, including energy efficiency, Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) needs to establish a long-term strategic energy technology roadmap (ETRM) in the hydrogen economy sector for sustainable economic development. In this paper, we establish a strategic ETRM for hydrogen energy technologies in the hydrogen economy considering five criteria: economic impact (EI), commercial potential (CP), inner capacity (IC), technical spin-off (TS), and development cost (DC). As an extended research, we apply the integrated two-stage multi-criteria decision-making approach, including the hybrid fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, to assess the relative efficiency of hydrogen energy technologies in order to scientifically implement the hydrogen economy. Fuzzy AHP reflects the vagueness of human thought with interval values, and allocates the relative importance and weights of four criteria: EI, CP, IC, and TS. The DEA approach measures the relative efficiency of hydrogen energy technologies for the hydrogen economy with a ratio of outputs over inputs. The result of measuring the relative efficiency of hydrogen energy technologies focuses on 4 hydrogen technologies out of 13 hydrogen energy technologies. KIER has to focus on developing 4 strategic hydrogen energy technologies from economic view point in the first phase with limited resources. In addition, if energy policy makers consider as some candidates for strategic hydrogen technologies of the other 9 hydrogen energy technology, the performance and productivity of 9 hydrogen energy technologies should be increased and the input values of them have to be decreased. With a scientific decision-making approach, we can assess the relative efficiency of hydrogen energy technologies efficiently and allocate limited research and development (R&D) resources effectively for well-focused R&D. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {Electricity grids with a high penetration of fluctuating energy production from wind and solar energy sources bear a risk of electricity over-production. A surplus of renewable energy can arise at times of high production when the energy volume cannot be absorbed by the electricity grid. Furthermore, the control of the stochastic power fluctuations has to be addressed since these will result in changes to grid stability. Producing hydrogen from excess electricity is one approach to solve these problems. This hydrogen can either be sold outside the electricity market, for instance as vehicle fuel, or re-converted into electricity, for instance as a means of controlling wind power output. This paper describes two different wind-hydrogen systems and analyses the ensuing costs of hydrogen per unit of energy service (i.e. kWh and Nm3). If hydrogen is to represent a practical fuel alternative, it has to compete with conventional energy carriers. If this is not possible on strictly (micro-) economic terms, at least a macro-economic calculation, in this case including all external costs of energy services, needs to show competitiveness. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {Fast depletion of fossil fuels is demanding an urgent need to carry out research work to find out the viable alternative fuels for meeting sustainable energy demand with minimum environmental impact. In the future, our energy systems will need to be renewable and sustainable, efficient and cost-effective, convenient and safe. The technology for producing hydrogen from a variety of resources, including renewable, is evolving and that will make hydrogen energy system as cost-effective. Hydrogen safety concerns are not the cause for fear but they simply are different than those we are accustomed to with gasoline, diesel and other fossil fuels. For the time being full substitution of diesel with hydrogen is not convenient but use of hydrogen in a diesel engine in dual fuel mode is possible. So Hydrogen has been proposed as the perfect fuel for this future energy system. The experiment is conducted using diesel-hydrogen blend. A timed manifold induction system which is electronically controlled has been developed to deliver hydrogen on to the intake manifold. The solenoid valve is activated by the new technique of taking signal from the rocker arm of the engine instead of cam actuation mechanism. In the present investigation hydrogen-enriched air has been used in a diesel engine with hydrogen flow rate at 0.15 kg/h. As diesel is substituted and hydrogen is inducted, the NOx emission is increased. In order to reduce NOx emission an EGR system has been developed. In the EGR system a lightweight EGR cooler has been used instead of bulky heat exchanger. In this experiment performance parameters such as brake thermal efficiency, volumetric efficiency, BSEC are determined and emissions such as oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, smoke and exhaust gas temperature are measured. Dual fuel operation with hydrogen induction coupled with exhaust gas recirculation results in lowered emission level and improved performance level compared to the case of neat diesel operation. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

After the system dynamic model setting up export and operation, the output shows the data changes of the total hydrogen demand and the four kinds of hydrogen demand. According to the analysis of the output, two conclusions are concluded: The secondary industry, not the tertiary industry (mainly the transportation), should be firstly satisfied by the hydrogen R&D and support of Government policy. Change of Chinese hydrogen demand scale, on basis of its economic growth, can not be effective explained through Chinese economic growth rate, and other influencing factor and mechanism should be probed deeply. © 2009 Professor T.

	abstract = {Hydrogen as an energy currency, carrier and storage medium may be a key component of the solution to problems of global warming, poor air quality and dwindling reserves of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Hydrogen is a flexible storage medium and can be generated by the electrolysis of water. It is particularly advantageous if an electrolyser may be simply and efficiently coupled to a source of renewable electrical energy. This paper examines direct coupling of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyser to a matched solar photovoltaic (PV) source for hydrogen generation and storage. Such direct coupling with minimum interfacing electronics would lead to substantial cost reduction and thereby enhance the economic viability of solar-hydrogen systems. The electrolyser is designed for fail-safe operation with multiple levels of safety and operational redundancy. A control system in the electrolyser unit provides for disconnection when required and for auto-start in the morning and auto shut-down at night, simultaneously addressing the goals of minimum energy loss and maximum safety. The PV system is a 2.4 kW array (20.4 m2 total area) comprising 30, 12 V, 80 W, Solarex polycrystalline modules in a series-parallel configuration. The integrated system has been operated for approximately 60 days over a 4-month period from September 2007 to January 2008 with many periods of unattended operation for multiple days, experiencing weather ranging from hot and sunny (above 40 °C) to cool and cloudy. The principle and practicality of direct coupling of a suitably matched PV array and PEM electrolyser have been successfully demonstrated. Details of electrolyser operation coupled to a PV array along with modelling work to match current-voltage characteristics of the electrolyser and PV system are described. Crown Copyright © 2009.},

	abstract = {The introduction of hydrogen infrastructure and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) to gradually replace gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles can provide environment and energy security benefits. The deployment of hydrogen fueling infrastructure to support the demonstration and commercialization of FCVs remains a critical barrier to transitioning to hydrogen as a transportation fuel. This study utilizes an engineering methodology referred to as the Spatially and Temporally Resolved Energy and Environment Tool (STREET) to demonstrate how systematic planning can optimize early investments in hydrogen infrastructure in a way that supports and encourages growth in the deployment of FCVs while ensuring that the associated environment and energy security benefits are fully realized. Specifically, a case study is performed for the City of Irvine, California - a target area for FCV deployment - to determine the optimized number and location of hydrogen fueling stations required to provide a bridge to FCV commercialization, the preferred rollout strategy for those stations, and the environmental impact associated with three near-term scenarios for hydrogen production and distribution associated with local and regional sources of hydrogen available to the City. Furthermore, because the State of California has adopted legislation imposing environmental standards for hydrogen production, results of the environmental impact assessment for hydrogen production and distribution scenarios are measured against the California standards. The results show that significantly fewer hydrogen fueling stations are required to provide comparable service to the existing gasoline infrastructure, and that key community statistics are needed to inform the preferred rollout strategy for the stations. Well-to-wheel (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, urban criteria pollutants, energy use, and water use associated with hydrogen and FCVs can be significantly reduced in comparison to the average parc of gasoline vehicles regardless of whether hydrogen is produced and distributed with an emphasis on conventional resources (e.g., natural gas), or on local, renewable resources. An emphasis on local renewable resources to produce hydrogen further reduces emissions, energy use, and water use associated with hydrogen and FCVs compared to an emphasis on conventional resources. All three hydrogen production and distribution scenarios considered in the study meet California's standards for well-to-wheel GHG emissions, and well-to-tank emissions of urban ROG and NOX. Two of the three scenarios also meet California's standard that 33% of hydrogen must be produced from renewable feedstocks. Overall, systematic planning optimizes both the economic and environmental impact associated with the deployment of hydrogen infrastructure and FCVs. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

	abstract = {The ever increasing demand for energy and the concerns on the environmental sustainability issue all around the world lead to more interest in alternative sources for energy production. However, as the current costs of the alternative sources such as solar, wind energy conversion systems etc. are relatively higher as compared to the conventional means of energy production, an optimum sizing approach is quite necessary in order to avoid over-sizing of such systems without lowering the reliability of load demand supply in all possible conditions including the variability of meteorological conditions or the changing power demand of load. There are many research papers available in the literature dealing with this optimum sizing issue. Even the mentioned papers significantly contribute to the wider penetration of such sources, none of them consider the power output degradation of alternative energy sources due to aging during their pre-defined operating life time. Besides, there are a few studies utilizing detailed dynamic models of energy sources apart from first-degree linear equations based models that may fall short in presenting the exact dynamics of the related system. Thus, an "observe and focus" algorithm based optimization of a hybrid alternative energy system considering the power output degradation and detailed models of each hybrid system component is performed in this study. Related details presented within the paper can provide a new perspective in optimum sizing of such hybrid systems and may further be considered in future updates of famous sizing software programs commercially or freely available in websites of several laboratories or universities. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Through the use of thermochemical cycles it is possible to use renewable energy to produce hydrogen from water, with the dual purpose of having an unlimited source of energy without producing greenhouse gases. This paper provides an energy assessment and a preliminary design of an industrial plant for the production of 100 tons/day of hydrogen by sulfur-iodine thermochemical cycle. Afterwards, an economic analysis is performed to assess the hydrogen production cost, with the assumption to power the process by solar energy. For this purpose, a double solar facility is sized: a parabolic trough plant, for the mean temperature duties, and a central receiver tower one for the higher temperature duties. The efficiency of the thermochemical cycle by itself is about 34%. If this value is associated with the electrical energy production, including the efficiency of the solar plants, the total heat-to-hydrogen efficiency of 21% is obtained, with a hydrogen production cost of about 8.3 /kg. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {Hydrogen can be used as a buffer for storing intermittent electricity produced by solar plants and/or wind farms. The MYRTE project in Corsica, France, aims to operate and test a large scale hydrogen facility for regulating the electricity produced by a 560 kWp photovoltaic plant. Due to the large quantity of hydrogen and oxygen produced and stored (respectively 333 kg and 2654 kg), this installation faces safety issues and safety regulations constraints that can lead to extra costs. These extra costs may concern detectors, monitoring, barrier equipments, that have to be taken into account for evaluating the system's total cost. Relying on the MYRTE example that is an R&D platform, the present work consists in listing the whole environmental and safety regulations to be applied in France on both Hydrogen and Oxygen production and storage. A methodology has been developed [1,2] for evaluating safety extra costs. This methodology takes into account various hydrogen storage technologies (gaseous and solid state), and is applicable to other ways of storage (batteries, etc.) to compare them. Results of this work, based on a forecast of the operating platform over 20 years, can be used to extrapolate and/or optimize future safety costs of next large scale hydrogen systems for further PV or wind energy storage applications. © 2013, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {Due to the fact that the environmental issues have become more serious recently, interest in renewable energy systems, such as, fuel-cells (FCs) has increased steadfastly. Among many types of FCs, proton exchange membrane FC (PEMFC) is one of the most promising power sources due to its advantages, such as, low operation temperature, high power density and low emission. However, using sole PEMFC for dynamic loads may not be feasible to satisfy the peak demand changes. Therefore, hybridizing PEMFC and an energy storage system (ESS) decreases the FC cost and improves its performance and life. Ultra-capacitor (UC) is the most powerful candidate to hybridize with PEMFC for dynamic loads. The DC-DC converter is the key enabling technology for hybridization of PEMFC and UC. Generally, the efficiency and performance of hybridization is largely limited by the converter topology employed for the mentioned hybridization. Integrating each source (PEMFC and UC) with a DC-DC converter is not feasible in terms of cost, performance, and control. Due to the above mentioned reasons, an attractive converter topology which can combine PEMFC and UC is strongly required. In this regard, the objective of this study is to design and simulate a novel double input DC-DC converter based on current additivity concept, in order to combine two different types of energy systems (PEMFCs and UCs).Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

	abstract = {In this paper, specific cases for the interaction between the future electricity-generation mix and a newly-developing hydrogen-production infrastructure is modelled with the model E-simulate. Namely, flexible integrated-gasification combined-cycle units (IGCC) are capable of producing both electricity and hydrogen in different ratios. When these units are part of the electricity-generation mix and when they are not operating at full load, they could be used to produce a certain amount of hydrogen, avoiding the costly installation of new IGCC units for hydrogen production. The same goes for the massive introduction of renewable energies (especially wind), possibly generating excess electricity from time to time, which could then perhaps be used to produce hydrogen electrolytically. However, although contra-intuitive, the interaction between both 'systems' turns out to be almost negligible. Firstly, it is shown that it is more beneficial to use IGCC facilities to produce hydrogen with, rather than (excess) wind-generated electricity due to the necessary electrolyser investment costs. But even flexible IGCC facilities do not seem to contribute substantially to the early development of a hydrogen economy. Namely, in most scenarios - which are combinations of a wide range of fuel prices and carbon taxes - one primary-energy carrier (natural gas or coal) seems to be dominant, pushing the other, and the corresponding technologies such as reformers or IGCCs, out of the market. © 2009.},

	abstract = {Currently, the hydrogen storage method used aboard fuel cell electric vehicles utilizes pressures up to 70 MPa. Attaining such high pressures requires mechanical gas compression or hydrogen liquefaction followed by heating to form a high-pressure gas, and these processes add to the cost and reduce the energy efficiency of a hydrogen fueling system. In previous work we have evaluated the use of high-pressure electrolysis, in which hydrogen is generated from water and the electrolyzer boosts the hydrogen pressure to values from 13 to 45 MPa. While electrolytic compression is a novel and energy efficient method to produce high-pressure hydrogen, it has several limitations at present and will require more development work. Another concept is to use hydrogen absorbing alloys that form metal hydrides, in combination with a heat engine (hot and cold reservoirs), to drive a cyclic process in which hydrogen gas is absorbed and desorbed to compress hydrogen. Furthermore, by using a thermally-driven compressor, the hot and cold reservoirs can be obtained using renewable energy such as sunlight for heating together with ambient air or water for cooling. In this work we evaluated the thermodynamics and kinetics of a prototype metal hydride hydrogen compressor (MHHC) built for us by a research group in China. The compressor utilized a hydrogen input pressure of approximately 14 MPa, and, operating between an initial temperature of approximately 300 K and a final temperature of 400 K, a pressure of approximately 41 MPa was attained. In a series of experiments with those conditions the average compression ratio for a single-stage compression was approximately three. In the initial compression cycles, up to 300 g of hydrogen was compressed for each 100 K temperature cycle. The enthalpy of the metallic-alloy-hydriding reaction was found to be approximately 20.5 kJ per mole of H 2, determined by measuring the pressure composition isotherm at three temperatures and using a Van't Hoff plot. The thermodynamic efficiency of the compressor, as measured by the value of the compression work performed divided by the heat energy added and removed in one complete cycle, was determined via first and second law analyses. The Carnot efficiency was approximately 25%, the first law efficiency was approximately 3-5%, and the second law efficiency was approximately 12-20%, depending on the idealized compression cycle used to assign a value to the compression work, as well as other assumptions. These efficiencies compare favorably with values reported for other thermally-driven compressors. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The overall work has been performed following three steps: energy needs analysis; local RES availability analysis; energy balance of Sport Centres. Considering that each sport facility is characterized by different energy needs depending on the sport typology itself, the analysis started from the features established by the CONI (National Italian Olympic Committee) standardization. For calculations a program in LabVIEW has been developed to evaluate the energy requirements of the sports centre considering as inputs the sport halls, the playgrounds and the supporting rooms, the level of the sport activity (e.g. agonistic) and the climatic conditions of the area where the facilities are located. The locally available RES are evaluated in order to decide which one can be exploited to feed the Sport Centre. The proposed solution for the energy production refers to a combination of different and innovative technologies which involve, in particular, hydrogen technologies.

The effect of technological learning on the outcome is also analysed for the period up to 2050.

	abstract = {The increase in the global energy demand every year and the over-consumption of nonrenewable sources of energy has led to the identification and use of renewable and cost effective sources of energy. In this context, wastewater, which contains high levels of easily degradable organic material, has gained importance as a source of electricity generation using a microbial fuel cell. A microbial fuel cell comprising of Pseudomonas sp., mediator, and potassium ferricyanide as the oxidizing agent was developed for generation of electricity using wastewater, as substrate, obtained from wastewater treatment plant. The cells were connected in series with the anodic and cathodic solutions being introduced in batch and continuous modes. A maximum open-circuit potential of 2.2 V was obtained with the anode in batch-fed and cathode in continuous mode of operation. Methylene blue, when used as the mediator was found to produce a higher output from the cell when compared to neutral red. The maximum power output and current density obtained were 979 μW/m2 and 1.15 mA/m2 respectively. A 10% reduction in COD was observed when the microbial fuel cell was operated using the wastewater as the substrate. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

In this context the transport of energy in form of chemical carriers is proposed supplementary to electrical transmission. Because of their high storage density and good manageability under ambient conditions Diesel-like LOHC substances could be transported within the infrastructure that already exists for the handling of liquid fossil fuels (e.g. oil tankers, tank trucks, pipelines, etc.).

Several jurisdictions around the world are planning to reduce or close their coal power plants to allow for renewable energy expansion, such as Ontario, Canada. Hydrogen storage, which is a promising energy storage option, is capable of meeting energy requirements that will arise from the shutdown of coal plants. In this paper, both economic and environmental feasibility of a hydrogen system linked with wind and hydroelectric plants in Ontario will be investigated. The Princefarm wind power plant and Beck1 hydro plant with production capacities of 189 MW and 490 MW, respectively, are analyzed in a case study for comparison purposes. The environmental analysis demonstrates the advantageous role of hydrogen storage and energy conversion. The overall system life-cycle yields 31.02 g CO 2 eq per 1 kW h power output of the system when hydrogen energy storage is adopted. The payback periods of the systems linked with the Princefarm and Beck1 are also analyzed and found to be about 17 years. Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

This work presents an improved thermo-kinetics model for simulation of hydrogen combustion in SI engines. The turbulent propagating flame is modeled using turbulent burning velocity model. During combustion the charge is divided into three zones containing unburned charge, flame and burned gas. The adiabatic flame is assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium while the detailed chemical kinetics scheme is considered for burned and unburned zones. The results were first validated against published experiments. Good agreements were obtained between simulation and experiment for varying equivalence ratio, ignition timing and compression ratio. Detailed analysis of engine NOX emission was performed afterward. The lean-burn and EGR strategies' potentials were examined by the current model. The effects of different amounts of cooled dry EGR and hot wet EGR on the NOX emission, engine power output and indicated thermal efficiency were investigated and compared theoretically. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a serious public health problem throughout the world, especially in industrialized and developing countries. In industrialized and developing countries, motor vehicle emissions are major contributors to urban air quality. Hydrogen is one of the clean fuel options for reducing motor vehicle emissions. Hydrogen is not an energy source. It is not a primary energy existing freely in nature. Hydrogen is a secondary form of energy that has to be manufactured like electricity. It is an energy carrier. Hydrogen has a strategic importance in the pursuit of a low-emission, environment-benign, cleaner and more sustainable energy system. Combustion product of hydrogen is clean, which consists of water and a little amount of nitrogen oxides. Hydrogen has very special properties as a transportation fuel, including a rapid burning speed, a high effective octane number, and no toxicity or ozone-forming potential. It has much wider limits of flammability in air than methane and gasoline. Hydrogen has become the dominant transport fuel, and is produced centrally from a mixture of clean coal and fossil fuels (with C-sequestration), nuclear power, and large-scale renewables. Large-scale hydrogen production is probable on the longer time scale. In the current and medium term the production options for hydrogen are first based on distributed hydrogen production from electrolysis of water and reforming of natural gas and coal. Each of centralized hydrogen production methods scenarios could produce 40 million tons per year of hydrogen. Hydrogen production using steam reforming of methane is the most economical method among the current commercial processes. In this method, natural gas feedstock costs generally contribute approximately 52-68% to the final hydrogen price for larger plants, and 40% for smaller plants, with remaining expenses composed of capital charges. The hydrogen production cost from natural gas via steam reforming of methane varies from about 1.25 US$/kg for large systems to about 3.50 US$/kg for small systems with a natural gas price of 6 US$/GJ. Hydrogen is cheap by using solar energy or by water electrolysis where electricity is cheap, etc. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

Given is a superstructure of alternatives that embeds a set of available technologies to produce, store and deliver hydrogen. The objective of our study is to determine the optimal design of the production-distribution network capable of fulfilling a predefined hydrogen demand. The design task is formulated as a multi-scenario mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) that considers the uncertainty associated with the coefficients of the objective function of the model (i.e. operating costs, raw materials prices, etc.). The novelty of the approach presented is that it allows controlling the variation of the economic performance of the hydrogen network in the space of uncertain parameters. This is accomplished by using a risk metric that is appended to the objective function as an additional criterion to be optimized. An efficient decomposition method is also presented in order to expedite the solution of the underlying multi-objective model by exploiting its specific structure. The capabilities of the proposed modeling framework and solution strategy are illustrated through the application to a real case study based on Spain, for which valuable insights are obtained. © 2010 Professor T.

The goal is to find the most economical ways of producing hydrogen solely via electrolysis from water, using electricity from hydro and geothermal power. The mixed integer programming model presented here facilitates the search for optimal choices from the 23 potential power plants, 11 of which are based on geothermal sources, and 12 are hydropower stations. The best locations for hydrogen production are in the southwest region of Iceland and the least expensive hydrogen production is at energy demand between 2 and 4 TWh/yr. At lower demand, the cost of energy is relatively higher, due to inefficient use of power plants and transfer lines. At higher demand, the cost of constructing new power transfer lines increases, leading to higher overall energy costs. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

One is to minimize the negative impact of fossil fuel systems by installing carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Energy and exergy balances are applied to determine exergy flows and efficiencies for individual devices and the overall system. A 'base case' analysis considers the proposed system without modification, while a 'modified case' extends the base case by considering the possibility of multiple product outputs. It is determined that solar photovoltaic-based sub-systems have the lowest exergy efficiencies (14-18%) and offer the most potential for improvement. A comparison of these two scenarios shows that the additional outputs raise the exergy efficiency of the modified case (11%) relative to the base case (4.0%).

	abstract = {Hong Kong is highly vulnerable to energy and economic security due to the heavy dependence on imported fossil fuels. The combustion of fossil fuels also causes serious environmental pollution. Therefore, it is important to explore the opportunities for clean renewable energy for long-term energy supply. Hong Kong has the potential to develop clean renewable hydrogen energy to improve the environmental performance. This paper reviews the recent development of hydrogen production technologies, followed by an overview of the renewable energy sources and a discussion about potential applications for renewable hydrogen production in Hong Kong. The results show that although renewable energy resources cannot entirely satisfy the energy demand in Hong Kong, solar energy, wind power, and biomass are available renewable sources for significant hydrogen production. A system consisting of wind turbines and photovoltaic (PV) panels coupled with electrolyzers is a promising design to produce hydrogen. Biomass, especially organic waste, offers an economical, environmental-friendly way for renewable hydrogen production. The achievable hydrogen energy output would be as much as 40% of the total energy consumption in transportation. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

A key observation is that the transition towards a large-scale H2 supply infrastructure is economically viable, if designed optimally with a holistic long-term systems perspective. However, the well-to-tank (WtT) CO2 emission reduction potential is limited (ca. 30%), which can be improved (ca. 85%) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The spatially-explicit nature of the framework facilitates the design of efficient networks with a high network-wide WtT energy efficiency (ca. 50% or more). Furthermore, H2 is observed to have the potential to alleviate Dutch energy security concerns.

Past research has shown H-CNG can reduce tailpipe emissions of both criteria and greenhouse gas pollutants relative to diesel, CNG, and gasoline [1-3]. However, an unanswered question is how Delhi will satisfy the potential hydrogen demand in a sustainable manner. We conduct a techno-economic assessment of hydrogen production from gasification of the three most abundant agricultural residues near Delhi - rice straw, cotton stalk, mustard stalk - and find these residues could provide the city with up to 270,700 metric tons per year of hydrogen. This quantity far exceeds what is needed to run all existing CNG vehicles on 18%-82% H-CNG blends. The cost of each step of the biohydrogen supply chain is calculated and the total cost is estimated at 149.6 rupees ($3.39) per kg. Lastly, we show that the price of H-CNG at the pump would be roughly equivalent to CNG on a per mile basis. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Biological systems offer a variety of ways by which to generate renewable energy. Among them, unicellular green algae have the ability to capture the visible portion of sunlight and store the energy as hydrogen (H2). They hold promise in generating a renewable fuel from nature's most plentiful resources, sunlight and water. Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria have the ability of capturing the near infrared emission of sunlight to produce hydrogen while consuming small organic acids. Dark anaerobic fermentative bacteria consume carbohydrates, thus generating H2 and small organic acids. Whereas efforts are under way to develop each of these individual systems, little effort has been undertaken to combine and integrate these various processes for increased efficiency and greater yields. This work addresses the development of an integrated biological hydrogen production process based on unicellular green algae, which are driven by the visible portion of the solar spectrum, coupled with purple photosynthetic bacteria, which are driven by the near infrared portion of the spectrum. Specific methods have been tested for the cocultivation and production of H2 by the two different biological systems. Thus, a two-dimensional integration of photobiological H2 production has been achieved, resulting in better solar irradiance utilization (visible and infrared) and integration of nutrient utilization for the cost-effective production of substantial amounts of hydrogen gas. Approaches are discussed for the cocultivation and coproduction of hydrogen in green algae and purple photosynthetic bacteria entailing broad utilization of the solar spectrum. The possibility to improve efficiency even further is discussed, with dark anaerobic fermentations of the photosynthetic biomass, enhancing the H2 production process and providing a recursive link in the system to regenerate some of the original nutrients. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {Hubbert's Peak will be reached by 2011. Thereafter, the world economy will be threatened by energy starvation. Nuclear energy costs much more than certain renewables: the needed 1800 reactors would take 50 years to build. Wind energy could supply the whole country: its building time might be reduced to 10 years. The available energy from coal would be 6 percent of what is known to be there. But its application to drive heat engines would be subject to the Second Law of Thermodynamics and hence yield only one-third of what is thought available: 20 years if applied to run America. No known method of sequestration of CO2 on earth would be reliable for more than 10 years. The Administration's plans to use coal and nuclear are unacceptable and so is the latest: biofuels. Brazil's success with them is due to her use of sugar cane fermentation to alcohol. We do not have the necessary land area and must use corn, a process involving gasoline energy more than the energy of the alcohol produced. Wind, solar, and eventually hot rock geothermal can supply all the energy we need, will never exhaust, and are entirely clear. There are intelligent, knowledgeable men who avor we can withstand the challenge of Hubbert's Peak with C-containing fuels. Tar sands need natural gas to distill out the oil. Abiogenic methane has been know to have no basis. Methane in the tundra is not a potential fuel but its release, now occuring, is the greatest threat we have. The view ahead is dark and threatening.

Wind power generation depends on the unpredictable nature of the wind. If the wind-power penetration becomes high in the Spanish electrical grid, energy management will be necessary for some wind farms. A method is proposed in this paper to adjust the generation curve to the demand curve, consisting of the generation of hydrogen and storing it in a hydrogen tank during off-peak (low demand) hours, while during the rest of the hours (peak hours, high demand) the stored hydrogen can be used to generate electricity. After revising the results obtained in this paper, for the current values of efficiency of the electricity-hydrogen-electricity conversion (approximately 30%) and due to the high cost of the hydrogen components, for a wind-hydrogen system to be economically viable the price of the sale of the energy generated by the fuel cell would be very high (approximately 171 c€/kWh). © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

This assessment is reported, using first the conversion of electricity to hydrogen, and then conversion of the hydrogen to methane. The paper also compares the alternative of direct injection of hydrogen into existing CNG pipelines to create "hythane" (HCNG).

	abstract = {This study addresses economic aspects of introducing renewable technologies in place of fossil fuel ones to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike for traditional fossil fuel technologies, greenhouse gas emissions from renewable technologies are associated mainly with plant construction and the magnitudes are significantly lower. The prospects are shown to be good for producing the environmentally clean fuel hydrogen via water electrolysis driven by renewable energy sources. Nonetheless, the cost of wind- and solar-based electricity is still higher than that of electricity generated in a natural gas power plant. With present costs of wind and solar electricity, it is shown that, when electricity from renewable sources replaces electricity from natural gas, the cost of greenhouse gas emissions abatement is about four times less than if hydrogen from renewable sources replaces hydrogen produced from natural gas. When renewable-based hydrogen is used in a fuel cell vehicle instead of gasoline in a IC engine vehicle, the cost of greenhouse gas emissions reduction approaches the same value as for renewable-based electricity only if the fuel cell vehicle efficiency exceeds significantly (i.e., by about two times) that of an internal combustion vehicle. It is also shown that when 6000 wind turbines (Kenetech KVS-33) with a capacity of 350 kW and a capacity factor of 24% replace a 500-MW gas-fired power plant with an efficiency of 40%, annual greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by 2.3 megatons. The incremental additional annual cost is about $280 million (US). The results provide a useful approach to an optimal strategy for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. Crown Copyright © 2006.},

	abstract = {A comparison is made between the ambient and conventional temperature alkaline electrolysers in terms of operational system, voltage efficiency and corrosion rates. The capital, operational and maintenance costs are reduced by reducing auxiliary equipment as well as auxiliary utilities in the ambient temperature alkaline electrolyser. Also, since auxiliary electricity consumption is reduced, the alkaline electrolyser is capable for dynamic, continuous and fast-response operation with renewable energy sources. The ambient temperature alkaline electrolyser is capable for wider operational range and faster response time when powered by wind energy sources. Although the voltage efficiency for hydrogen production is increased by about 12% at the conventional operating temperature, corrosion rate of the electrode is increased by a factor of about 6.3. The voltage efficiency for hydrogen production, however, is increased by about 12% by employing electrocatalyst in the ambient temperature alkaline electrolyser, and there is benefit of enhancing lifetime durability of the electrode as well as cell components at relatively lower operating temperature.Copyright © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Many countries including China have their own plan to support the research of hydrogen, because of its premier features. But, at present, the cost of hydrogen energy production, storage and transportation process is higher than that of fossil energy and its commercialization progress is slow. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) was used in this paper to evaluate the cost of hydrogen energy throughout the life cycle focused on the stratagem selection, to demonstrate the costs of every step and to discuss their relationship. Finally, the minimum cost program is as follows: natural gas steam reforming - high-pressure hydrogen bottles transported by car to hydrogen filling stations - hydrogen internal-combustion engines. © 2009 Professor T.

Employing gasification only to produce the same amount of hydrogen, leads to a cost figure of 37 SEK/kg H2, and for an electrolyser only a production cost of 41 SEK/kg H2. The distribution of capital and operating cost is quite different for the three options and a sensitivity analyses was performed for all of these.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a promising energy vector; however, finding methods to produce it from renewable sources is essential to allow its wide-scale use. In that line, biological hydrogen production, although it is considered as a possible alternative, requires substantial improvements to overcome its present low yields. In that direction, genetic manipulation probably will play a central role and from that point of view metabolic flux analysis (MFA) constitutes an important tool to guide a priori most suitable genetic modifications oriented to a hydrogen yield increase. In this work MFA has been applied to analyze hydrogen photoproduction of Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. Flux analysis was carried out based on literature data and several basic fluxes were estimated in different growing conditions of the system. From this analysis, an upper limit for hydrogen photoproduction has been determined indicating a wide margin for improvement. MFA was also used to find a feasible operating space for hydrogen production, which avoids oxygen inhibition, one of the most important limitations to make hydrogen production cost effective. In addition, a set of biotechnological strategies are proposed that would be consistent with the performed mathematical analysis. © 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

A case study of Hawaii's fuel-energy balance by the end of the 21st century which features two scenarios, a 'Business-as-Usual' energy system, based on imported fossil fuels, and a 'Renewable-Energy' scenario, based on an alternative energy system consisting entirely of indigenous, renewable energy resources, is presented. In the year 2100, a projected total energy consumption of approximately 335 million gigajoules would be provided from a hypothetical renewable-energy system of approximately 13 gigawatts-electric of installed capacity. This system would feature methanol-from-biomass to meet liquid fuel requirements for surface transportation, industrial, commercial, and residential sectors; hydrogen via electrolysis in liquid form for air transportation and as a gaseous fuel for industrial purposes; and electricity generated from geothermal, ocean thermal, wind, and photovoltaic sources for all power applications. A comprehensive economic analysis, including capital costs, operating and maintenance costs, air pollution costs for the total fuel cycle of each energy system, and a local multiplier effect factor of 3·75 per dollar, indicates that between the years of 1987 and 2100 the 'Business-as-Usual' scenario will have expended approximately $600 billion (1986 US dollars), and the 'Renewable-Energy' scenario will have cost approximately $400 billion. By switching from imported fossil fuels to indigenous, renewable energy resources during this time period, Hawaii's citizens could save approximately $200 billion to help preserve paradise. © 1994.},

Two main scenarios are constructed, differing in the degree of decentralisation of energy production and management: one resembles the current system with centralised facilities and commercial management, the other being based upon a projected scale-independent cost structure of energy producing and handling equipment, that will allow extreme decentralisation of the physical energy conversion system, possibly accompanied by a similar decentralisation of ownership and control.

	abstract = {Increasingly, hydrogen is being promoted as an alternative energy carrier for a sustainable future. Many argue that its use as a transportation fuel in fuel cell vehicles offers a number of attractive advantages over existing energy sources, especially in terms of well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions. Following this interest, several of the leading energy companies, like BP, have started investigating strategies for its introduction. The challenge of developing a future commercial hydrogen economy clearly still remains, though: what are the energy efficient, environmentally benign and cost effective pathways to deliver hydrogen to the consumer? Establishing what these "best" pathways may be is not trivial, given that a large number of technological options exist and are still in development for its manufacturing, storage, distribution and dispensing. Cost, operability, reliability, environmental impacts, safety and social implications are all performance measures that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, we present a generic optimization-based model for the strategic long-range investment planning and design of future hydrogen supply chains. By utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques, the model is capable of identifying optimal investment strategies and integrated supply chain configurations from the many alternatives. Realizing also that multiple performance criteria are of interest, the optimization is conducted in terms of both investment and environmental criteria, with the ultimate outcome being a set of optimal trade-off solutions representing conflicting infrastructure pathways. Since many agree that there is no one single template strategy for investing in a hydrogen infrastructure across the globe, emphasis is placed on developing a generic model such that it can be readily applied to different scenarios, geographical regions and case studies. As such, the model supports BP's strategic hydrogen infrastructure planning using high-level optimization programming, and is coined bpIC-H2. The features and capabilities of the model are illustrated through the application to a case study. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Within the Saudi-German project HYSOLAR, system studies have been done to identify potential applications of solar hydrogen. This paper presents an economic system design of autonomous grids including hydrogen storage (made up of an electrolyser, pressure storage and a fuel cell). A renewable energy supply (photovoltaic, wind energy converter) is used to match the electrical load of an island community. The effects of different weather conditions and share of PV/wind energy production on system design are investigated. Overall electricity costs are calculated for different financial parameters. Electricity costs depend strongly on intensity and profile of weather and type of converter, which makes a careful investigation of the optimal mixture of PV/wind power necessary. Even if the calculated electricity costs indicate economically feasible situations, much work is still to be done in order to optimize the system configuration and to demonstrate hydrogen storage working reliably in isolated grids. © 1993.},

	abstract = {An electrolyzer and a fuel cell have been integrated in a small-scale stand-alone renewable energy system to demonstrate that hydrogen can be used for long-term stationary energy storage. The economic and environmental performance of such a system is strongly related to the ability of the electrolyzer to convert electrical energy to hydrogen and the ability of the fuel cell to convert hydrogen back to electrical energy, which together define the round-trip efficiency of the hydrogen storage system. One promising way to improve the efficiency as well as to decrease the capital costs of the fuel cell is to recuperate the oxygen from the electrolyzer and use it as the fuel cell oxidant instead of compressed air. This paper presents the modifications made to the system in order to implement oxygen recuperation. The round-trip system efficiency was found to be 18% with oxygen recuperation and 13.5% without it. © 2004 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A steady state model has been developed which analyses process performances, the costs of each of the stages in hydrogen production, storage and distribution, and estimates material and energy requirements for building and operating the Solar Hydrogen Energy System. Analysis of the solar hydrogen production, storage and distribution has shown that the price of delivered hydrogen depends mostly on the cost of available solar technologies (photovoltaic cells and wind turbines) and their efficiencies. The real cost of transportation has been calculated for both gasoline, as the existing fuel for surface transportation, and hydrogen as an alternative in the future. The real cost includes environmental and societal damage caused either by burning the fuel or by processing it.

Due to the superior properties of hydrogen , with respect to efficiency and environmental characteristics, when burned in specially adapted combustion engines, gas turbines and fuel cells, the present EQHHPP phase focuses on hydrogen applications in future potential markets related to the transport sector. The overall goal of the demonstration phase of the EQHHPP is to advance hydrogen applications. Studies on hydrogen safety, regulations and acceptability, and on socio-economic aspects of hydrogen use, will support the technological development and demonstration activities. In that framework, various demonstration projects were started in 1992, with funds coming from the European Commission, from the Government of Québec and from industry and research centres. The demonstration projects mainly concern the utilization of hydrogen in airborne and urban transportation, the time frame being 1992 to 1997.},

The model incorporates a constraint concerning the CO2 emissions generated from the various energy production and consumption activities. The results show that a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can be achieved through a large scale integration of RES into the energy system.

Fossil fuel and renewable technologies are investigated, and the assessment is divided into various stages. Energy efficiencies and greenhouse gas emissions are evaluated in each step for crude oil and natural gas pipeline transportation, crude oil distillation and natural gas reformation, wind and solar electricity generation, hydrogen production through water electrolysis, and gasoline and hydrogen distribution and utilization. The results indicate that, when taking into account fossil fuel energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, the efficiency of a fuel cell vehicle employing hydrogen from natural gas should be at least 25-30% higher than the gasoline one to be competitive. Wind electricity generation to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, and its application in a PEMFC vehicle, has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel energy consumption. However, the economic attractiveness of renewable wind technology is shown to depend significantly on the ratio in costs between hydrogen and natural gas; when this ratio is 2:1, a financial investment to produce hydrogen via natural gas is about five times more profitable than to do so via wind energy. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

	abstract = {Fueled by concerns about urban air pollution, energy security, and climate change, the notion of a "hydrogen economy" is moving beyond the realm of scientists and engineers and into the lexicon of political and business leaders. Interest in hydrogen, the simplest and most abundant element in the universe, is also rising due to technical advances in fuel cells - the potential successors to batteries in portable electronics, power plants, and the internal combustion engine. But where will the hydrogen come from? Government and industry, keeping one foot in the hydrocarbon economy, are pursuing an incremental route, using gasoline or methanol as the source of the hydrogen, with the fuel reformed on board vehicles. A cleaner path, deriving hydrogen from natural gas and renewable energy and using the fuel directly on board vehicles, has received significantly less support, in part because the cost of building a hydrogen infrastructure is widely viewed as prohibitively high. Yet a number of recent studies suggest that moving to the direct use of hydrogen may be much cleaner and far less expensive. Just as government played a catalytic role in the creation of the Internet, government will have an essential part in building a hydrogen economy. Research and development, incentives and regulations, and partnerships with industry have sparked isolated initiatives. But stronger public policies and educational efforts are needed to accelerate the process. Choices made today will likely determine which countries and companies seize the enormous political power and economic prizes associated with the hydrogen age now dawning. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

	abstract = {Photovoltaic conversion appears as a very promising technology in order to achieve the technical and economic goals for penetration into the electric energy market. Nevertheless, a serious limit to the very large diffusion of PV systems is due to the intermittence of solar radiation. Hydrogen produced via water electrolysis can be considered as an useful means to store solar energy and overcome this limit. With reference to a stand-alone power plant configuration, a PV system, integrated with electrolytic hydrogen production and a fuel cell reconversion line, is examined in order to check the technical suitability of supplying electricity to a load with time continuity. A mathematical method, which utilizes as input data the monthly average values of solar energy density on a horizontal surface is presented, which permits us to size the PV array as a function of the annual load diagram for a given solar site. The results demonstrate that PV-H2 systems are suitable for realizing a modular stand-alone solar power station able to supply continuously generic loads. © 1993.},

	abstract = {A long-term hydrogen-based scenario of the global energy system is described in qualitative and quantitative terms here, illustrating the key role of hydrogen in a long-term transition toward a clean and sustainable energy future. In an affluent, low-population-growth, equity and sustainability-oriented B1-H2 world, hydrogen technologies experience substantial but plausible performance and costs improvements and are able to diffuse extensively. Corresponding production and distribution infrastructures emerge. The global hydrogen production system, initially fossil based, progressively shifts toward renewable sources. Fuel cells and other hydrogen-using technologies play a major role in a substantial transformation toward a more flexible, less vulnerable, distributed energy system which meets energy needs in a cleaner, more efficient and cost-effective way. This profound structural transformation of the global energy system brings substantial improvements in energy intensity and security of supply and results in an accelerated decarbonization of the energy mix, with subsequent relatively low climate impacts. Such energy-system path might still not be sufficient to protect against the risk of high climate sensitivities, but hydrogen-based technologies emerge as flexible options for the energy system and, thus, would be prime candidates for a risk management strategy against an uncertain climate future. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

	abstract = {A comparison of energy storage media for carbon free systems was made on a cost and weight basis for application with renewable energy sources such as hydropower. On a seasonal timescale (summer to winter), storage of hydrogen in liquid organic hydrides was equivalent to other carbon free alternatives and superior to zero emission systems like batteries. Seasonal energy storage is illustrated by the methylcyclohexane toluene-hydrogen (MTH) system. Low cost summer electricity is used for water electrolysis to yield hydrogen for hydrogenation of toluene. Dehydrogenation in winter gives hydrogen for heat and power generation by fuel cells with an estimated overall electrical efficiency of 41%. Recent laboratory results using commercial, dehydrogenation catalysts in fixed bed reactors show how catalyst efficiency was increased (low by-products) to reduce the carbon emissions to 0.01 kgC/kWhc. Hydrogen separation membranes and new molecular reactions are being investigated to further increase efficiencies. Economic analyses show that the seasonal storage of hydroelectric power with hydrogen by the MTH system is economically competitive with new hydropower projects. © 1998 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {The "Hydrogen economy", in which hydrogen will be a main carrier of energy from renewable sources, is a long term prospect. In the near and medium term increasing demand for hydrogen - also as an energy carrier in special niches - will probably be covered by hydrogen from fossil sources, mainly natural gas. This can be acceptable from an environment as well as an economical point of view, since hydrogen can be produced from natural gas at acceptable costs, without release of CO2 to the atmosphere. There are two main options for this: (1) hydrogen from natural gas by conventional technology (e.g. steam reforming) including CO2 sequestration; (2) high temperature pyrolysis of natural gas, yielding pure hydrogen and carbon black. Technologies for industrial scale realisation of these options have been developed and evaluated in Norway, which is a large producer and exporter of natural gas. The economy and market opportunities are discussed in the paper. It appears that renewable energy costs must come down considerably from present levels before hydrogen from renewables can compete with hydrogen from natural gas without release of CO2 to the atmosphere. © 1998 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

The 100 pilot project is to demonstrate the provision of clean and renewable primary energy in the form of Canadian hydropower converted via electrolysis into hydrogen and shipped to Europe, where it is stored and used in different ways: electricity/heat cogeneration, vehicle and aviation propulsion and hydrogen enrichment of natural gas for use in industry and households. Three transport/storage modes are investigated: methylcyclohexane as energy carrier shipped in normal oil product carriers, ammonia shipped in special tankers and liquid hydrogen shipped in special LH2 ships and aeroplanes. First evaluations indicate costs of the electrolytic hydrogen, produced with hydropower at 2 Can, cents kWh-1, stored in a European port of 69 Dpfg Nm-3 for the methylcyclohexane mode, 57 Dpfg Nm-3 for the ammonia mode, 30 Dpfg Nm-3 for the LH2 mode by ship transportation and 77/68 Dpfg Nm-3 by air transportation. These averaged equivalent costs of 20 Dpfg kWh-1 (th) of clean, renewable and stored energy suggest competitivity within the not too distant future. © 1990.},

	abstract = {The twin requirements of reducing CO2 emission levels and increasing the level of penetration of renewable energy will involve innovative technical and operational solutions. This paper describes a novel but proven process (CO2 + 3 H2 → CH3OH + H2O) which could be adapted to use, as input reagents, CO2 emitted from fossil-fuelled power stations and hydrogen from electrolysis of water by a zero-emissions electricity source, e.g. renewable and/or nuclear energy. This approach, in addition to addressing the above two issues, would produce methanol for which there is a ready and expanding market. A preliminary analysis is presented of the process economics and operational regimes necessary in the UK Electrical Supply Industry to accommodate the methanol plant. Four different designs are assessed, all based on a supply of renewable energy limited to 16 h/day when demand is off-peak. Option 'A' relies on a variable 100-500 MW supply, whereas Option 'B' makes use of a steady 100 MW during the availability period. Option 'C' is identical to 'B', except for the use of pressurised electrolysers at 30 bar instead of conventional ones. Option 'D' departs from 'B' with the use of hydrogen-powered fuel cells for power generation during the period of no availability. In the absence of a market for the electrolytic oxygen, Option 'B' is found to be the most economical, and it should be profitable if a favourable taxation regime applies on zero-emission automotive fuels. However, if the oxygen can be sold to a local industry via pipeline, Option 'C' could be potentially viable, even in the absence of tax breaks. It is claimed that significant benefits might accrue from successful development of a methanol process and that it may ease the absorption of increasing levels of embedded generation into the electricity supply network. © 2002 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.
