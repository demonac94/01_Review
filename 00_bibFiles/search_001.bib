	abstract = {As a key material for manufacturing clean energy technologies, steel is crucial for energy transition, but its production causes 2.6 Gton of CO2 emissions at global level each year. In 2020 the European Union (EU) set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, fostering innovation in the steel industry to reduce its environmental impact. However, a scenario-oriented and technologically comprehensive analysis assessing prospected environmental and market implications of steel decarbonisation strategies remains a gap, which is addressed in this paper. The analysis adopts a hybrid input-output-based life-cycle assessment model built in the MARIO framework, extending the Exiobase database to represent the supply chains of the most promising low-carbon steelmaking technologies in the EU, such as hydrogen- or charcoal-injected blast furnaces and natural gas- and hydrogen-based direct reduction routes. The penetration of these technologies is explored by formulating scenarios resembling European climate targets. The results show a reduction in the carbon footprint of steel across all scenarios, ranging up to −26% in 2030 and to −60% in 2050. However, the extent of footprint reduction is highly dependent on the share of clean electricity in the European supply mix, highlighting the relevance of holistic decarbonisation strategies. Economic implications affect steel prices, which rise up to 25% in 2030 and 56% in 2050, opening discussions on the need for suitable policies such as CBAM to avoid protectionism and encourage international technological progress. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {This paper investigates the techno-economic implications on air travel when fossil-based kerosene is phased out of the market, specifically focusing on the comparison between liquid hydrogen, liquid methane and renewable kerosene for ten exemplary flight routes to estimate the cost of air travel per passenger and 100 km distance travelled [Formula presented] for every fuel type. By considering the entire supply chain, including hydrogen production from renewable sources, synthesis, oversea transport, domestic distribution, and utilization, this study addresses the overarching question of whether it is more economical to change the fuel source or the fuel itself to reduce fossil kerosene usage in the aviation industry. It is demonstrated that aircraft acquisition costs play a minor role compared to fuel supply costs and specific fuel demand. The study shows that for electricity-based fuels, liquid hydrogen is the most economic option, even with a potential energy penalty, followed by liquid methane and renewable kerosene. The results for an aircraft with a capacity 180 passengers are 3.08, 4.57 and 5.11 [Formula presented] for liquid hydrogen, liquid methane and renewable kerosene, respectively. Challenges regarding storage and isolation requirements for cryogenic fuels in aviation are discussed, with assumptions made that these obstacles can be overcome to realize economic benefits. Additionally, the study suggests potential shifts in aircraft size selection by airlines to mitigate rising fuel prices in the future. The study advocates for the aviation industry's openness to new fuels like liquid hydrogen and liquid methane to alleviate the cost increase associated with phasing out fossil kerosene. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Shifting from fossil fuels to clean alternative fuel options such as hydrogen is an essential step in decarbonising the road freight transport sector and facilitating an efficient transition towards zero-emissions goods distribution of the future. Designing an economically viable and competitive Hydrogen Supply Chain (HSC) to support and accelerate the widespread adoption of hydrogen powered Heavy Goods Vehicles (H2-HGVs) is, however, significantly hindered by the lack of the infrastructure required for producing, storing, transporting and distributing the required hydrogen. This paper focuses on a bespoke design of a hydrogen supply chain and distribution network for the long-haul road freight transportation in the UK and develops an improved end-to-end and spatially-explicit optimisation tool to perform scenario analysis and provide important first-hand managerial and policy making insights. The proposed methodology improves over existing grid-based methodologies by incorporating spatially-explicit locations of Hydrogen Refuelling Stations (HRSs) and allowing further flexibility and accuracy. Another distinctive feature of the method and the analyses carried out in the paper pertains to the inclusion of bulk geographically agnostic, as well as geological underground hydrogen storage options, and reporting on significant cost saving opportunities. Finally, the curve for H2-HGVs penetration levels, safety stock period decisions, and the transport mode capacity against hydrogen levelized cost at pump have been generated as important policy making tools to provide decision support and insights into cost, resilience and reliability of the HSC. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is widely considered as the energy carrier of the future, but the rather high energy losses for its production are often neglected. The major current hydrogen production technology is steam methane reforming of fossil gas, but there is a growing interest in producing hydrogen sustainably from water using electrolysis. This article examines four main hydrogen production chains and two transportation options (pipeline and ship) from North Africa to Europe, analyzing the costs and environmental impacts of each. The core objective is to determine the most promising hydrogen provision method and location from an economic and ecological point of view, including the required transport. An important finding of this analysis is that both options, importing green hydrogen and producing it in Europe, may be relevant for a decarbonized energy system. The emphasis should be on green hydrogen to achieve carbon emission reductions. If blue hydrogen is also considered, attention should be paid to the often-neglected methane emissions upstream. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The primary focus of zero-emission aviation initiatives has been the utilization of hydrogen, drop-in biofuels, and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as substitutes for fossil-based jet fuels. These alternatives aim to achieve immediate reductions in carbon emissions while minimizing disruptions to the existing aircraft fleet and supporting infrastructure. However, the cost-competitiveness of large-scale production remains a challenge despite significant advancements in fuel manufacturing. In this scientific paper, we explore the potential of ammonia as a near-zero emission carrier for green hydrogen in aviation. Ammonia is proposed not only as a hydrogen carrier, but also as a means for compressor intercooling and cooling air, NOx elimination, and reduction of contrail formation through water vapor condensation. We present a two-fold investigation, beginning with a comprehensive discussion on alternative fuels that identifies ammonia as a suitable carrier for aviation. Subsequently, we examine the implications and possibilities of ammonia at both the airframe and engine system levels. Due to its existing presence in the fertilizer industry, ammonia benefits from a robust supply chain and established expertise in handling large volumes of the substance, despite its higher toxicity compared to hydrogen and other prospective aviation fuels. Furthermore, we demonstrate the feasibility of heat exchangers for compressor intercooling and turbine cooling, facilitated by ammonia's non-coking properties. These results pave the way for the development of efficient zero-emission engine cores. © 2024 by Mozhdeh Hooshyar, Ciprian Dumitrache.},

	abstract = {While the European Union has set ambitious targets to decouple all emissions from chemical production processes, the current European chemical industry is dependent on fossil fuels for energy use and as feedstocks. The import of products across the chemical supply chain is a critical component of the European chemical industry, and a transition to a power-to-chemicals structure provides an opportunity to locally supply chemical feedstocks. This study develops a techno-economic model to examine the supply chain options and applies a life-cycle analysis to assess the climate impacts for electricity-based polyethylene (e-polyethylene), the most produced ethylene derivative and chemical, for four European regions of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, Spain, and Finland under seven polyethylene supply chain configurations compared to local production. A hydrogen cost of 27 €/MWh in 2050 is found to lead to ethylene costs similar to those in Europe today, at 631 €/t. By 2050, local e-polyethylene production costs in Europe range from 712–1406 €/t. Imports of electricity-based methanol and e-polyethylene lead to levelised costs ranging from 56–118% and 42–108% of locally produced e-polyethylene by 2050, respectively, whereas hydrogen imports lead to 119–235% of local e-polyethylene production costs. Cradle-to-gate life-cycle results find that fully local e-polyethylene production has 15–61% lower greenhouse gas emissions than fossil polyethylene production. However, if the carbon content of the plastic is considered, negative carbon footprints can be achieved. The availability of low-cost electricity-based chemicals in southern Europe and North Africa and limited land availability in central Europe may therefore drive critical European investments to develop economically competitive power-to-chemical supply chains. © 2024 The Authors},

To facilitate this transition in energy that will replace fossil fuels with more renewable sources, it is key to understand the role of energy storage in supply chains of the future energy mix. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy, hydrogen is gaining traction to store this energy and thereby plays a major role towards achieving greener energy systems. As multiple segments within the hydrogen supply chain are presently being investigated extensively to enable deployment at larger scales, there is considerable uncertainty associated with the progress of the supply chain as a whole. Furthermore, these supply chains will not only need to account for the uncertainties that come with the energy transition, but those that inherently exist for all supply chains. Accordingly, there is a need to incorporate resilience into the design and optimization of hydrogen supply chain networks that account for such uncertainties. Through this work, an optimization-based model is presented to analyze the trade-offs that exist between economic and environmental decision objectives when resilience is considered. In this manner, strategies for managing disruptions within the context of energy security and sustainable development can be developed to adapt to changing circumstances. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Through an international survey of energy-sector and sustainability professionals (n = 179), we investigated the desirable sustainability features for renewable hydrogen SCLs and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of sustainability certification. Our mixed-method study revealed general accordance on the feasible inclusion of diverse sustainability criteria in SCLs, albeit with varying degrees of perceived essentiality. Within the confines of the data, some differences in viewpoints emerged based on respondents’ geographical and supply chain locations, which were associated with the sharing of costs and benefits. Qualitatively, respondents found the idea of SCL harmonisation attractive but weighed this against the risks of duplication, complicated administrative procedures, and contradictory regulation. The implications of this research centre on the need for further studies to inform policy recommendations for an overarching SCL sustainability framework that embodies the principles of harmonisation in the context of multistakeholder governance. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The REPowerEU plan establishes the production objective of 35 billion m3 of biomethane in the European Union (EU) by 2030. Biomethane is an excellent energy vector to promote the defossilization of different sectors within a Power-to-Gas approach. The present study evaluates the economic and environmental implications of producing biomethane from the biogas generated in a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) with a treatment capacity of 100,000 m3/d and 500,000 population equivalents. The techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) were conducted for a biomethane production plant based on biological methanation process using the hydrogen produced in a water electrolyser. The TEA illustrated that the electricity price (0–0.20 €/kWh) features an important impact on the biomethane cost (0.05–0.23 €/kWhHHV) due to the high electrolyser energy consumption. Flexible operation of the electrolyser is economically feasible at load factors above 35 %, which can be attributed to the lower impact of the electrolyser capital cost as the load factor increases. The LCA illustrated that biomethane has a lower global warming impact (<0.28 kg CO2-eq/kWhHHV) than fossil natural gas when the renewable electricity production in the mix is above 62 %. The results highlighted that high carbon prices under the EU Emission Trading System is an important driver to promote biomethane production in European countries since energy production from biomethane could be exempted to acquire emission allowances. This would provide a competitive advantage of biomethane over natural gas when considering the whole supply chain of the energy carrier. Overall, this study demonstrates that biological methanation has the potential to become an important biomethane production technology for future defossilization scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s)},

The technical, economic, and environmental aspects of both markets are provided. Then, a case study of the Permian Basin is rendered to show the effects of hydrogen in the region. In this study, the HDSAM model is used to obtain the cost of hydrogen. A function to predict the hydrogen demand for hydraulic fracking is provided based on real data. The results obtained in this study are as follows. First, the results for heavy-duty vehicles show that hydrogen demand is equal to 148 (tonnes/day), and hydrogen cost is 7.58 ($/kg). The refueling station is the major contributor to the hydrogen cost. Among refueling station components, compressor and storage induce significant costs. Liquid hydrogen is cheaper than gas hydrogen. Switching costs from diesel trucks to hydrogen trucks is equal to 0.65 ($/miles). If the payload and dwell time costs are considered, hydrogen trucks can even be cheaper than EV trucks. Second, the results for hydraulic fracking show that hydrogen demand is equal to 334 (tonnes/day) considering 1430 wells in the Permian Basin. The hydrogen cost is 4.22 ($/kg). If hydrogen is used instead of diesel in fracking, 3.41×106 kg CO2-eq as well as 4.10×107 kg of NOx can be saved from emissions. The hydrogen cost is equal to or even less than the diesel cost to generate 1 horsepower-hour for hydraulic fracking. This work can be expanded by investigating ammonia. Its features can be compared with hydrogen in terms of stability for long-term storage, transmission, and the globally established infrastructure. In addition, the tax credits of 45Q can be compared with 45 V and its effects can be analyzed. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

These low costs are attracting investors. However, due to the scope of the respective studies, not all techno-economic aspects of the supply-chain that influence levelized costs of hydrogen are considered. This work represents a systematical analysis of the levelized costs of hydrogen in Egypt by using wind and solar power for producing 40 kt per year of green hydrogen. A maximal investment volume of four billion euros, and an available area of 37 km2 in central Egypt is assumed. The techno-economic evaluation of the system, from the production site to the selling location, is conducted by a mixed-integer linear optimization model. Depending on the system configuration and production site, the study reveals energy losses of 52–61% of the harvested energy and a levelized costs of hydrogen of 7.17–12.31 €/kg. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The steel industry's clean energy transition can enable new market creation and economic growth stimulation. Yet, the most efficient and feasible pathway to decouple the sector from fossil fuels remains unclear, particularly within developing nations and unstable socio-political contexts. Here, a blueprint for reconfiguring plant locations and reallocating resources is developed through a Ukrainian case study under two scenarios, which capture potential post-war conditions. Framed by regrowth of Ukraine's export-oriented steel industry and prospective European Union accession, green iron and steel trade strategies are devised. A steel supply chain optimisation model underpins the techno-economic, spatially granular analysis of energy and material flows, which utilises the inputs from a separate cost-minimised renewable energy, green hydrogen, and green ammonia production model. Results show that optimal supply chain configurations rely on mixed emissions-free energy profiles, the emergence of new steelmaking sites nearby high-quality renewables, regional alliances for green iron and steel market creation, and multi-billion-dollar investment. Mature nuclear and hydro power critically reduce costs in the near-term, whilst the rapid expansion of solar and wind energy infrastructure underpins production system scale-up. To simultaneously rebuild the 22 million-tonnes-a-year Ukrainian steel industry and transition to near-zero emissions by 2050, infrastructure investment surmounts to $62 billion, given full liberation of Ukrainian territory. Near-term investment is necessary to ease the pace of change, and although mobilising capital of this magnitude will be challenging, convincing carbon prices favour decarbonisation efforts. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Recent global trends have increasingly focused on sustainable and green energy solutions,transitioning away from fossil fuels. Green hydrogen (GH) and green ammonia (GA) have emerged as promising contenders for energy carriers in international supply chains. Our manuscript delivers a thorough comparative analysis of GH and GA, acknowledging the complex interrelations among synthesis, storage, distribution, and conversion processes. This evaluation also incorporates the variability of weather, energy demand, and the delays inherent in shipping, on both hourly and seasonal scales. The study features a detailed case analysis of nine international trading routes, utilizing a hierarchical optimization framework and conducting comparative economic evaluations. Additionally, the study delves into a sensitivity analysis, exploring factors such as economies of scale and the operational constraints of water electrolyzer. One of the key findings of our research is the identification of GA as a more favorable option for an international energy carrier, particularly when considering renewable energy's seasonality and intermittency. GA's superior storage and transportation properties significantly mitigate uncertainties within the supply chain, offering a more robust solution in the context of green energy transportation and logistics. Furthermore, the techno-economic analyses survey their impact on each supply chain and reveal the interconnectedness between each supply chain element – power, conversion, storage, and transportation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), comprising: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain, is home to an abundant number of resources, including natural gas and solar and wind energy (renewables). Because of this, the region is favourably positioned to become a significant player in both blue and green hydrogen production and their export. Current dependence on fossil fuels and ambitious national targets for decarbonisation have led the region and world to research the feasibility of switching to a hydrogen economy. This literature review critically examines the current advantages and strategies adopted by the GCC to expedite the implementation of hydrogen supply chains, as well as investigation into the methodologies employed in current research for the modelling and optimisation of hydrogen supply chains. Insight into these endeavours is critical for stakeholders to assess the inherent challenges and opportunities in establishing a sustainable hydrogen economy. Despite a substantial global effort, establishing a solid hydrogen supply chain presently faces various obstacles, including the costs of clean hydrogen production. Scaling-up storage and transport methods is an issue that affects all types of hydrogen, including carbon-intensive (grey) hydrogen. However, the current costs of green hydrogen production, mostly via the process of electrolysis, is a major obstacle hindering the widescale deployment of clean hydrogen. Research in this literature review found that compressed gas and cryogenic liquid options have the highest storage capacities for hydrogen of 39.2 and 70.9 kg/m3, respectively. Meanwhile, for hydrogen transportation, pipelines and cryogenic tankers are the most conventional and efficient options, with an efficiency of over 99 %. Cryogenic ships to carry liquid hydrogen also show potential due to their large storage capacities of 10,000 tonnes per shipment, However, costs per vessel are currently still very expensive, ranging between $ 465 and $620 million. © 2024 The Author(s)},

Both biomass availability and cost-effective mobilization are necessary to facilitate large bioenergy production sites. This study uses a Geographical Information System approach to map the economic and environmental feasibility of future biofuel production sites via Hydrothermal Liquefaction. The methodology includes process modelling, biomass and infrastructure mapping, technoeconomic analysis and greenhouse gas impact assessment and is implemented having Denmark as case study. Three supply-chains were evaluated for the upgrading of the biofuel which are chemical stabilizing, on-site hydrotreating, and centralised hydrotreating. The two feedstocks assessed were imported forestry and domestic agricultural residue resulting in a total of six different implementation scenarios. The results for the case study indicate that for forestry residue the proximity to an industrial port is the most dominating factor when determining feasible site locations. The performance in the agricultural residue scenarios is more impacted by infrastructure parameters. In the on-site hydrotreating scenario the best performing locations are found close to the hydrogen line to reduce connection expenses. For centralised hydrotreating the results favour being close to existing refineries to reduce intermediate transportation of the biocrude. © 2023 The Authors},

To explore the potential energy arbitrage of integrated power-to-hydrogen systems (IP2HSs) across power systems and hydrogen supply chains, we propose a long-duration robust optimization (LDRO) framework for IP2HSs considering energy, ancillary services, and hydrogen markets. A unified capacity bidding model in the ancillary service market is established for fuel cells and electrolyzers of IP2HSs to simulate the bidding strategy in typical markets. The hybrid hydrogen demand model is based on the Cournot model considering the cost-competitiveness of hydrogen in different sectors. A direct solution method combining the column-and-constraint generation algorithm and strong duality theory is proposed for the LDRO framework with quadratic terms. Uncertainty sets are constructed based on day-ahead prices in typical markets. A case study investigates the feasibility of energy arbitrage and the ability of the LDRO framework to deal with long-duration price uncertainties in 15 markets. The results highlight the advantages of hybrid hydrogen demand and the sensitivity of energy arbitrage by IP2HSs to different parameters.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on investigating the potential of methane pyrolysis process for low-carbon, low-cost hydrogen production when compared to alternative hydrogen production technologies. The design, techno-economic analysis, and GHG emission assessment of two different methane pyrolysis configurations, molten metal-based and thermal plasma-based, are conducted. In addition, to assess the effect of heat sources on both environmental and economic aspects of methane pyrolysis, three heating options are considered for the molten metal-based process: a gas-fired heater, a hydrogen-fired heater, and an electrical heater. Results are then compared against other hydrogen production technologies, including electrolysis, SMR without CCS, SMR with CCS, and biomass gasification. The data required for techno-economic analysis and assessing GHG emissions is obtained from Aspen Plus® process simulation models and U.S. DOE's H2A Production Models. Our results indicate that the H2 minimum selling price associated with pyrolysis systems are almost always lower than that for SMR with CCS considering a natural gas price of $6/GJ, an electricity price of $0.06/kWh, and a carbon black price of $200/t. However, to achieve a H2 minimum selling price lower than that of SMR without CCS, a carbon black price higher than $500/t is required. Furthermore, the impact of the carbon intensity of the electricity grid and natural gas supply chain for different geographical locations are evaluated. For instance, the results for British Columbia revealed that the GHG emissions of the methane pyrolysis fall within the range of 0.76 and 2.58 kg CO2 eq./kg H2 and can be as low as 50% of that of the SMR with CCS for molten metal-H2 fired configuration. The highest GHG emissions are encountered in the SMR and electrolysis pathways. These analyses show the potential of methane pyrolysis in achieving both lower H2 minimum selling price and GHG emissions, especially when considering solid carbon as a marketable co-product. © 2024},

Temporal and spatial gaps exist between hydrogen production and utilization, necessitating infrastructure like storage and transportation for bridging. The challenge in optimizing hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) for transportation path planning lies in efficiently solving the complex network topology. This work presents a mathematical model of two-layer optimization based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and graph theory. Transportation route planning and wind farm selection are integrated to meet the hydrogen demand of hydrogen fuel vehicles (HFVs) over a period of time. The model enables the extraction of geographic information data and visualization of the optimal layout using ArcGIS software. Vehicle transportation and pipeline route hybrid transportation system based on Minimum Euclidean Steiner Tree (MEST) are obtained. The goal is to obtain the minimum total annual cost (TAC).

	abstract = {The toluene (TOL)-methylcyclohexane (MCH) system is one of the viable solutions because of its high stability and high hydrogen storage capacity (6.2%). However, the high volatilities of TOL and MCH and the accumulative byproducts make it difficult to transport hydrogen. Considering these limitations, we developed a new strategy introducing an extraction column and pressure swing adsorption with heat integration to reduce the required energy utilities. Furthermore, a comprehensive system-level analysis was conducted through an application example of the transport of hydrogen from Australia to Korea. The minimum transport cost of hydrogen was determined to be $2.17/kg-H2 via techno-economic analysis. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses revealed the influence of the economic and process parameters. Finally, a life cycle assessment was conducted to compare the environmental impact (EI) of each part. Although dehydrogenation is more energy-demanding than hydrogenation, hydrogenation has larger EIs for some factors including fossil resource scarcity (13% larger) and water consumption (746% larger), due to the toluene and hydrogen makeup. Furthermore, we compared changes in the EIs in the energy sources.

	abstract = {The European Union is committed to a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, as outlined in the Green Deal and Climate Law initiatives. In response to geopolitical events, the RePowerEU initiative aims to enhance energy self-sufficiency, reduce reliance on Russian natural gas, and promote hydrogen utilization. Hydrogen valleys, localized ecosystems integrating various hydrogen supply chain elements, play a key role in this transition, particularly benefiting isolated regions like islands. This manuscript focuses on optimizing a Centralized Green Hydrogen Production Facility (CGHPF) on the island of Crete. A mixed-integer linear programming framework is proposed to optimize the CGHPF, considering factors such as land area, wind and solar potential, costs, and efficiency. Additionally, an in-depth sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the impact of key factors on the economic feasibility of hydrogen investments. The findings suggest that hydrogen can be sold in Crete at prices as low as 3.5 EUR/kg. Specifically, it was found in the base scenario that, selling hydrogen at 3.5 EUR/kg, the net profit of the investment could be as high as EUR 6.19 million, while the capacity of the solar and wind installation supplying the grid hydrogen facility would be 23.51 MW and 52.97 MW, respectively. It is noted that the high profitability is justified by the extraordinary renewable potential of Crete. Finally, based on our study, a policy recommendation to allow a maximum of 20% direct penetration of renewable sources of green hydrogen facilities into the grid is suggested to encourage and accelerate green hydrogen expansion. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Growing global awareness of global warming has led to a focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting renewable energy. Energy storage is essential for ensuring a reliable power supply due to the intermittent nature of renewables. While green hydrogen (H2) is considered a clean energy carrier, it faces challenges such as high cost, safety concerns, and low volumetric energy density. In contrast, safer and cost-effective ammonia (NH3) offers higher volumetric energy density for storage. The study explores the Electricity-H2-NH3-H2-Electricity system, a promising low-carbon global renewable electricity transportation avenue. It involves an Aspen Plus process simulation, encompassing air separation, NH3 synthesis, and H2 generation from the NH3 decomposition process. We analyze renewable energy sources, NH3 transportation, process mass balance, and energy consumption and conduct economic and CO2 analyses. Three scenarios (current, near future, sustainable future) with varying technology levels and costs are presented. The findings reveal that 11.044–9.349 MWh of renewable electricity in exporting countries generates 1 tonne of NH3, then split, with 0.17 tonnes combusted to provide heat for the decomposition process and the remaining 0.83 tonnes converted to produce 0.145 tonnes of H2. This H2 is sent to fuel cells, yielding 1.711–2.436 MWh of imported electricity to the grid, with 575–141 USD/MWh cost. Additionally, the imported NH3 and H2 incur costs of 0.719–0.289 USD/kg and 5.993–2.362 USD/kg, respectively. Considering the heat integration of the fuel cells and NH3 decomposition process, an additional 23 % of H2 production is achieved (0.178 tonnes), and a 34 % increase in imported electricity is sent to the grid (2.370–3.259 MWh). This leads to a 27 % decrease in imported renewable energy costs (432–103 USD/MWh) and a 29 % reduction in H2 costs (4.087–1.666 USD/kg); the ultimate CO2 emission of the system is 318–36 kg/MWh. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Hydrometallurgy, acid dissolution, and electrochemical dissolution are shown to offer 2–7 times improvement across all assessed metrics relative to the manufacturing of PEMWE and PEMFC from raw materials. Recycling can also lower the raw material demand, material cost, energy use, and GHG emissions associated with PEMWE and PEMFC deployment in the United States in 2050 by 23%, 19%, 21%, and 16%, respectively.

In this study, we developed a simple, open-access, techno-economic model and applied it to the case of Japan and Australia to evaluate policy proposals. Then, we further investigated the uncertainty in the levelized cost of steel (LCOS) due to various factors by Monte Carlo analysis. Results show that, under many possible combinations, the relocation strategies showed a higher probability of being more cost competitive. However, full relocation did not significantly outperform partial relocation. Clean electricity costs and electrolyzer efficiency are dominant factors affecting the uncertainty of LCOS.

	abstract = {Modernising Australia's old truck fleet and adopting a more stringent standard to reduce emissions and air pollutants is a primary objective for the Australian truck sector. Various strategies worldwide have been introduced to cut emissions and pollutants in the truck sector, such as a low-emission strategy supported by strict diesel standards and a zero-emission strategy to shift to battery-electric or hydrogen trucks. The paper focuses on emissions and local air pollutants of trucks under various transition scenarios at both the tailpipe and the wider supply chain including domestic power generation and hydrogen production. In contrast, for diesel, we focus on tailpipe outputs following fuel standards in Australia, given diesel is imported other than in some limited refineries. We compare and recommend actions that government and truck operators may take in the near to longer term in transitioning to cleaner energy. We tested a number of scenarios using a decision support system incorporating all the latest information on costs and emissions for all truck classes using diesel, electric or hydrogen. A key finding from our scenario tests is that the current electricity mix has high carbon emissions and air pollutants due to fossil fuel-fired sources for power generation. Without improvement in using renewable energy sources in the future, transitioning to electric trucks implies more carbon emissions and air pollutants in the atmosphere from power plants, even though electric trucks generate zero tailpipe emissions. The main motivation for switching to zero-emission trucks is energy cost savings. We urge the government to decide on a clear roadmap for the truck sector before the sector is in a position to take action to shift to low or zero-emission trucks without totally relying on the likely reduction of emission intensity in electricity and renewable energy production. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The increasing political momentum advocating for decarbonization efforts has led many governments around the world to unveil national hydrogen strategies. Hydrogen is viewed as a potential enabler of deep decarbonization, notably in hard-to-abate sectors such as the industry. A multi-modal, hourly resolved, linear programming model was developed to assess the infrastructure requirements of a low-carbon supply chain over a large region. It optimizes the deployment of infrastructure from 2025 up to 2050 by assessing four years: 2025, 2030, 2040, and 2050, and is location agnostic. The considered infrastructure encompasses several technologies for production, transmission, and storage. Model results illustrate supply chain requirements in Texas and Louisiana. Edge cases considering 100% electrolytic production were analyzed. Results show that by 2050, with an assumed industrial demand of 276 TWh/year, Texas and Louisiana would require 62 GW of electrolyzers, 102 GW of onshore wind, and 32 GW of solar panels. The resulting levelized cost of hydrogen totaled $5.6–6.3/kgH2 in 2025, decreasing to $3.2–3.5/kgH2 in 2050. Most of the electricity production occurs in Northwest Texas thanks to high capacity factors for both renewable technologies. Hydrogen is produced locally and transmitted through pipelines to demand centers around the Gulf Coast, instead of electricity being transmitted for electrolytic production co-located with demand. Large-scale hydrogen storage is highly beneficial in the system to provide buffer between varying electrolytic hydrogen production and constant industrial demand requirements. In a system without low-cost storage, liquid and compressed tanks are deployed, and there is a significant renewable capacity overbuild to ensure greater electrolyzer capacity factors, resulting in higher electricity curtailment. A system under carbon constraint sees the deployment of natural gas-derived hydrogen production. Lax carbon constraint target result in an important reliance on this production method due to its low cost, while stricter targets enforce a great share of electrolytic production. © 2024 The Authors},

To address the challenges related to the high cost and substantial CO2 emissions linked to the state-of-the-art integrated MSR process, this study aims to propose and enhance an intensified MSR process focusing on energy utilization, economic viability and environmental impact. Aside from the MSR process, the overall scenario also includes the water–gas-shift reaction (WGS) process, CO2 capture using amine-based methods, liquefaction, and hydrogen purification through pressure-swing adsorption. Based on this study, apparent enhancements of the state-of-the-art MSR process can be achieved by adjusting key process variables, especially those related to the CO2 capture process, and by incorporating various intensification strategies, including heat integration (with feed-effluent heat exchangers) between the MSR and the WGS processes, implementing a side-draw intercooling structure of the CO2 absorber, splitting the rich solvent flow to the CO2 stripper, and employing a multi-stage CO2 stripper with vapor recompression. Compared to the state-of-the-art MSR process in the literature, the intensified MSR process produces ultra-pure hydrogen (99.99 mol%) as a main product while reduces 6.2 % of the shared cost (from 191.0 USD/t-MeOH to 179.1 USD/t-MeOH), increases the overall carbon capture rate by 3 % (from 86.73 % to 89.99 %), and reduces the direct CO2 emission by approximately 25 % (from 1.41 t-CO2/ t-MeOH to 1.06 t-CO2/ t-MeOH). Within a MeOH-based international renewable energy supply chain, these enhancements can also significantly lower the imported cost of electricity from 105.9 USD/MWh to 95.5 USD/MWh. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In an era marked by environmental crises and dwindling fossil resources, the need to revolutionize industrial processes for sustainability is paramount. Formaldehyde synthesis, a pivotal precursor in industries spanning polymers, resins, and textiles, stands at a critical juncture where innovation and necessity intersect. Conventional methods of formaldehyde production, despite their efficiency, remain tethered to non-renewable feedstocks and energy-intensive techniques, perpetuating ecological harm and resource constraints. This study explores eco-friendly pathways for formaldehyde production. Recent strides in bio-based chemistry enable the creation of formaldehyde from renewable biomass, reducing energy use and carbon emissions. Decentralized production with locally sourced biomass boosts supply chain resilience and community-centered sustainability. The research employs Aspen Plus® software to model a two-step process: gasification of a hybrid pine and mustard biomass blend to produce bio-methanol, followed by its oxidation into formaldehyde. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate temperature's impact on syngas composition, with higher temperatures favoring hydrogen production. The air-to-biomass ratio affects carbon dioxide content and energy content, crucial for efficient energy production. In formaldehyde synthesis, the air-to-methanol ratio significantly influences yield. Economically, formaldehyde bio- production shows promise, with an 8.50% return on investment and a 22.16-year payback period. An annual net profit of $2.41 million is projected, with a break-even point at $53.47 million in total sales revenue. This research underscores the convergence of sustainability, innovation, and economic viability in formaldehyde bio-production, offering valuable insights for environmentally friendly chemical manufacturing and the broader transition to ecological progress. © 2024 The Institution of Chemical Engineers},

	abstract = {Here, we show production pathways for greenhouse gas (GHG)-negative bio-based plastics from 2nd and 3rd generation feedstocks. We focus on bio-based plastics that are technically capable of replacing 80% of the global plastic market. By presenting life cycle inventories and discussing GHG-emissions hotspots, this work will inform stakeholders along the plastic supply chain of the necessary steps to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and potentially, how to drive net-uptake. This work is of critical importance given the overwhelming mass of plastic produced annually and the resulting CO2 emissions. To conduct this assessment, we derive life cycle inventories for nine different bio-based plastics and address the impact of methodological choices, such as allocation method, on the resulting 100a global warming potential (GWP). Our findings show that resources used and processing methods implemented have significant effects on the potential for us to derive carbon-negative plastics. Furthermore, we find that environmental impact quantification methods greatly influence the perceived GWP of such processes. For example, economic and mass allocation methods resulted in an apparent increase in GWP of up to 39% and 166%, respectively, compared to no allocation for bio-based plastics made from 2nd generation crops, whereas mass allocation resulted in the lowest GWP for bio-based plastics made from 1st generation crops. In considering environmental impact hotspots, our findings show that decarbonization of thermal energy and electricity, reduced use of ammonia-based fertilizer, renewable hydrogen production, use of bio-based alternatives for petrochemicals and plasticizers, enzyme production pathways from 2nd generation crops, and more efficient biomass conversion processes to reduce feedstock inputs may be critical steps in creating GHG-negative bio-based plastics in the future. © 2024},

	abstract = {The global commitment to the Paris Agreement has triggered the development of national hydrogen strategies and roadmaps in numerous countries. For seamless execution of a hydrogen strategy, the model employed in roadmap optimization must consider intricate operational details. This study offers a comprehensive multi-period model for hydrogen supply chain (HSC) expansion planning, spanning production to distribution. The model optimizes facility timing, location, type, and capacity while considering efficient operational strategies. Hydrogen, sourced diversely, anchors the supply chain, supported by precise calculations for road-based transport and pipelines. Storage facilities adapt to supply sources and transportation methods, addressing supply-demand fluctuations and transport interruptions. Hydrogen refueling stations (HRS) are optimized for efficient urban distribution. Analyzing South Korea's HSC in this model reveals a shift towards green hydrogen in later stages, initially relying on refineries and imports. Investments transition from pipelines to liquid (LH2) and gaseous (GH2) hydrogen trucks in the early phases, eventually incorporating NH3 tanker trucks. The model predicts a decreasing levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH), reaching $3.89/kg through HSC expansion planning. The model predicts a decreasing LCOH, reaching $3.89/kg through strategic HSC expansion. Transportation costs, playing a significant role in the final LCOH, are crucial for South Korea to achieve its target of 3000 KRW/kg. These results offer valuable insights for nations advancing hydrogen initiatives, providing a detailed cost breakdown model to guide policy planning and achieve HSC and LCOH objectives effectively. Also, the study showcases Korea's adeptness in transitioning to a hydrogen-based economy. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Republic of Korea intends to establish a nationwide hydrogen supply chain (HSC) infrastructure to promote the adoption of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. As the hydrogen demand for mobility may be higher than the estimated production capacity of existing facilities, additional on-site hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) are required. To address infrastructure deployment problems, a two-stage (demand and supply stages) optimization approach is proposed based on mixed-integer linear programming models. The maximal covering location and p-median models at the demand stage determine the location and chargers of the HRSs and the demand allocation to the stations. At the supply stage, the supply model determines the installation of additional on-site production facilities for the deployed HRSs and the supply allocation to the stations by minimizing the installation and transportation costs. We estimated high-resolution demand data using public sources and utilized investigated supply data from reputable institutions representing the hydrogen economy in the Republic of Korea. The proposed approach provides realistic HSC infrastructure deployment plans, satisfying over 90% of the hydrogen demand in the years 2025 and 2030. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis indicated the effects of various parameters on the deployment plan, including the demand coverage and the need for additional on-site HRSs to address potential hydrogen supply shortages. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

On-site “mother” stations produce hydrogen from city natural gas or water electrolysis, and off-site “daughter” stations are supplied with hydrogen from nearby on-site stations. This HRS system is a micro hydrogen supply chain that includes hydrogen suppliers, retailers, and end consumers characterized via demand functions. The present paper designs an optimal business model for this distributed HRS system using a multi-level game model, given that on-site and off-site HRS can operate individually or as a coalition to supply hydrogen. Stackelberg game and Shapley value models are constructed to explore how cooperative operation is superior by generating more profits than separate operation. Accordingly, in order to promote cooperation between on-site and off-site operators of HRS, an evolutionary game model is developed to investigate the allocation of profits and coordinated costs on the equilibrium of cooperative operation. The authors conclude that boosting the initial probabilities of actors to choose cooperative strategies and decreasing the coordinated cost can lead the game system to the ideal consequence. The present paper offers recommendations including establishing regulation standards for HRS operation, and advancing the information technology to design a more effective cooperative mechanism. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The energy sources that are used intensively in vehicles are generally non-renewable energy sources and they are in danger of being depleted as demand increases. To deal with this, countries are turning to hydrogen, which is considered a clean and renewable energy source. For hydrogen to be widespread, the Hydrogen Supply Chain (HSC) should be planned effectively. There are three key issues associated with an HSC. First, the uncertainty of future demand makes it difficult to design an HSC. Second, considering only the cost can bring along many other problems. One should also consider the associated risk and CO2 emission as well. Third, in addition to the steady state of HSC, the transition of the HSC throughout periods is also important. In this study, a multi-objective, multi-period stochastic model is proposed to address these three issues. The results show that facilities having low CO2 emission are opened in northern region of Turkey because of H2S sources in Black Sea and they serve the center and the eastern regions. The west and south, focus on more cost-effective solutions due to high population. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Flexibility has become increasingly important considering the intermittency of variable renewable energy in low-carbon energy systems. Electrified transportation exhibits great potential to provide flexibility. This article analyzed and compared the flexibility values of battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles for planning and operating interdependent electricity and hydrogen supply chains while considering battery degradation costs. A cross-scale framework involving both macro-level and micro-level models was proposed to compute the profits of flexible EV refueling/charging with battery degradation considered. Here we show that the flexibility reduction after considering battery degradation is quantified by at least 4.7% of the minimum system cost and enlarged under fast charging and low-temperature scenarios. Our findings imply that energy policies and relevant management technologies are crucial to shaping the comparative flexibility advantage of the two transportation electrification pathways. The proposed cross-scale methodology has broad implications for the assessment of emerging energy technologies with complex dynamics. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Turquoise Hydrogen, a new generation of hydrogen production, is much closer to green and less polluting than regular Hydrogen. Substantial evidence indicates that Mexico's organic waste has significant potential with this technology. Although Turquoise Hydrogen has not yet been implemented in Mexico, preliminary studies are necessary to facilitate its future deployment. Therefore, this work studies the potential types and volumes of suitable organic waste for pyrolysis in Mexico. Subsequently, based on the available statistics in the state of Nuevo León and the waste disposal and recovery methods, a model is developed to select the locations for waste control and pyrolysis. The optimization model in this study is formulated as a bi-objective problem and then transformed into an integer linear programming model. Furthermore, an analysis of executable scenarios for organizing Hydrogen's closed-loop supply chain is performed. The results indicate that the developed model in this research can significantly enhance the closed-loop cycle in municipal and industrial solid wastes. It can not only facilitate the separation of waste in gray hydrogen production but also redirect a substantial portion of recyclable waste to recycling centers, further reducing waste disposal. This model can serve as a foundation for selecting optimal locations and minimizing decision-maker costs in establishing and developing blue and turquoise Hydrogen in Mexico. Additionally, the discussion underscores the importance of the government's role in optimizing waste separation and maximizing supply chain efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to the low operation cost, high containment security, and large storage capacity, depleted shale gas reservoirs are considered as promising options for large-scale hydrogen storage. However, its feasibility has not been systematically examined yet. It is still unknown about whether the deliverability (injection/withdrawal) capacity could meet the energy supply/demand and how the depletion time, cushion gas selection, injection/withdrawal strategy will influence the performance of this scenario. Therefore, we present a numerical compositional modelling investigation on hydrogen storage in a partially depleted Fuling shale gas reservoir in China. The results demonstrated that: 1) a high injection/withdrawal capacity could be achieved through a single shale play pad in the area of interest as approximately 5.4 × 108 Sm3 hydrogen could be stored and 3 × 108 Sm3 could be recovered in each cycle (equal to 0.54 TWh of power output). 2) CH4 production is inhibited once hydrogen storage project is performed, an early depletion time could significantly reduce CH4 production but slightly improve H2 withdrawal. 3) Cushion gas injection is beneficial to reducing H2 loss and enhancing 2.8% H2 recovery, while the main drawback of this operational measure is an increase in capital cost in gas separation due to lower H2 purity in the produced gas. This work demonstrates that shale gas reservoir is a promising candidate for hydrogen storage, which is beneficial to the implementation of large-scale hydrogen economy and the operation of hydrogen supply chain. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The energy consumption of conventional 70-MPa hydrogen refueling stations (HRS) with liquid hydrogen (LH2) pumps remains at a high level due to the low efficiency of LH2 pumps working at extremely high pressures, up to nearly 90 MPa. This paper presents a novel HRS with significantly lower energy consumption, based on a step-by-step compression strategy enabled by a highly-efficient 50-MPa LH2 pump for low-pressure compression and a subsequent thermal compression module for high-pressure compression driven by thermal energy. The performance of the cryogenic pressure vessels in the HRS process is analyzed via a numerical model, and then several improvements to the HRS process are proposed for large-scale refueling requirements. Finally, the techno-economic performance of the HRS is compared with the conventional HRSs and the HRS with pure thermal compression. Compared to the conventional HRSs with 90-MPa LH2 pumps, the capital cost of the proposed 400-kg/day HRS is reduced to $1.52M from $1.80M, while its energy consumption is reduced to 0.3 kWh/kgH2 from 1.3 kWh/kgH2.

	abstract = {China is the largest coke producer and consumer. There is a pressing need to address the high emissions of air pollutants and carbon dioxide associated with traditional coking production. As the nation pursues a transition towards carbon neutrality, expanding supply chains for coking plants to produce hydrogen, methanol, and other green alternatives has garnered significant attention. However, the relative advantages of these strategies have remained uncertain. In this study, we integrate a life cycle assessment-economic analysis-scenario analysis model to evaluate various coke oven gas (COG) utilization routes (COGtM: COG-to-methanol, COGtLNG: COG-to-liquefied natural gas, COGtSA: COG-to-synthetic ammonia, and COGtH: COG-to-hydrogen). The results indicate that COGtSA emerges as the preferred option for balancing environmental and economic benefits. Meanwhile, COGtM demonstrates economic viability but is associated with higher environmental impacts. Despite being recognized as a significant strategic direction under carbon neutrality initiatives, COGtH faces economic feasibility and risk resilience limitations. COGtLNG encounters both financial and environmental challenges, necessitating strategic development from an energy security perspective. The projected coking capacity is anticipated to experience a slight increase in the mid-term yet a significant decline in the long term, influenced by steel production capacity. In potential future markets, COGtM is estimated to potentially capture a maximum market share of 16–34% in the methanol market. Furthermore, against the backdrop of continuously expanding potential demand for hydrogen, COGtH holds advantages as a transitional solution, but in the long run, it can only meet a small portion of the market. COGtSA can meet 7–14% of market demand and emerges as the most viable pathway from the viewpoint of balancing environmental and economic aspects and covering future markets. © 2024},

	abstract = {The aviation industry is responsible for over 2% of global CO2 emissions. Synthetic jet fuels generated from biogenic feedstocks could help reduce life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based fuels. This study assesses three processes for producing synthetic jet fuel via the synthesis of methanol using water and atmospheric CO2 or biomass. A life cycle assessment and cost analysis are conducted to determine GHG emissions, energy demand, land occupation, water depletion, and the cost of producing synthetic jet fuel in Switzerland. The results reveal that the pathway that directly hydrogenates CO2 to methanol exhibits the largest reductions in terms of GHG emission (almost 50%) compared to conventional jet fuel and the lowest production cost (7.86 EUR kgJF-1); however, its production cost is currently around 7 times higher than the petroleum-based counterpart. Electrical energy was found to be crucial in capturing CO2 and converting water into hydrogen, with the sourcing and processing of the feedstocks contributing to 79% of the electric energy demand. Furthermore, significant variations in synthetic jet fuel cost and GHG emissions were shown when the electricity source varies, such as utilizing grid electricity pertaining to different countries with distinct electricity mixes. Thus, upscaling synthetic jet fuels requires energy-efficient supply chains, sufficient feedstock, large amounts of additional (very) low-carbon energy capacity, suitable climate policy, and comprehensive environmental analyses. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The production of green hydrogen through electrolysis, utilizing renewable energies, is recognized as a pivotal element in the pursuit of decarbonization. In order to attain cost competitiveness for green hydrogen, reasonable generation costs are imperative. To identify cost-effective import partners for Germany, given its limited green hydrogen production capabilities, this study undertakes an exhaustive techno-economic analysis to determine the potential Levelized Cost of Hydrogen in Germany, Norway, Spain, Algeria, Morocco, and Egypt for the year 2050, which represents a critical milestone in European decarbonization efforts. Employing a stochastic approach with Monte Carlo simulations, the paper marks a significant contribution for projecting future cost ranges, acknowledging the multitude of uncertainties inherent in related cost parameters and emphasizing the importance of randomness in these assessments. Country-specific Weighted Average Cost of Capital are calculated in order to create a refined understanding of political and economic influences on cost formation, rather than using a uniform value across all investigated nations. Key findings reveal that among the evaluated nations, PV-based hydrogen emerges as the most cost-efficient alternative in all countries except Norway, with Spain presenting the lowest Levelized Cost of Hydrogen at 1.66 €/kg to 3.12 €/kg, followed by Algeria (1.72 €/kg to 3.23 €/kg) and Morocco (1.73 €/kg to 3.28 €/kg). Consequently, for economically favorable import options, Germany is advised to prioritize PV-based hydrogen imports from these countries. Additionally, hydrogen derived from onshore wind in Norway (2.24 €/kg to 3.73 €/kg) offers a feasible import alternative. To ensure supply chain diversity and reduce dependency on a single source, a mixed import strategy is advisable. Despite having the lowest electricity cost, Egypt shows the highest Levelized Cost of Hydrogen, primarily due to a significant Weighted Average Cost of Capital. © 2024 The Authors},

This work investigates the cost-optimal planning of European low-carbon hydrogen supply chains in the near term (2025–2035), comparing several hydrogen production technologies and considering multiple spatial scales. We focus on mature hydrogen production technologies: steam methane reforming of natural gas, biomethane reforming, biomass gasification, and water electrolysis. The analysis includes carbon capture and storage for natural gas and biomass-derived hydrogen. We formulate and solve a linear optimization model that determines the cost-optimal type, size, and location of hydrogen production and transport technologies in compliance with selected carbon emission targets, including the EU fit for 55 target and an ambitious net-zero emissions target for 2035. Existing steam methane reforming capacities are considered, and optimal carbon and biomass networks are designed. Findings identify biomass-based hydrogen production as the most cost-efficient hydrogen technology. Carbon capture and storage is installed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, while electrolysis remains cost-disadvantageous and is deployed on a limited scale across all considered sensitivity scenarios. Our analysis highlights the importance of spatial resolution, revealing that national perspectives underestimate costs by neglecting domestic transport needs and regional resource constraints, emphasizing the necessity for highly decarbonized infrastructure designs aligned with renewable resource availabilities. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This study developed a novel assessment framework to analyze long-term energy transition in the road transport sector in which various technology options, market shares, policy measures, costs, and greenhouse gas emissions are considered in a single framework analysis. A data-intensive model was developed with the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) and used to analyze policy scenarios up to 2050 for Alberta, Canada, a hydrocarbon-rich province with an emission-intensive energy sector. Three key policy measures – carbon pricing, zero-emission vehicle sales mandate, and incentivization – were analyzed in nine individual and combined policy scenarios. The transition to both hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles was assessed for all vehicle categories. Each fuel's full energy supply chain was modelled, including resource extraction, conversion, transmission and distribution, and fuelling, allowing for final and primary energy analysis. The findings show that carbon price and zero-emission vehicle incentives do not effectively lower greenhouse gas emissions on their own; zero-emission vehicle mandates are needed to transition the sector to a low-carbon energy system. The system-wide greenhouse gas emission footprints of hydrogen and battery electric vehicles are significantly below conventional vehicles in all cases. Scenarios biased towards battery electric vehicles had the most favorable results. The greenhouse gas emission footprint of hydrogen vehicles supplied by auto-thermal reforming with 91% carbon capture was lower than for battery electric vehicles powered by a primarily natural gas-based power grid. The findings on the effectiveness of carbon prices, incentives, and vehicle mandates should be considered by government policymakers aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, infrastructure planners, and other energy stakeholders. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Understanding robust pathways to achieve affordable, reliable, and equitable energy transitions to a decarbonized society has received growing attention. While existing energy transition literature emphasizes the role of government policy and technological innovation, little has been written to integrate “top-down” approaches encompassing government policy and “bottom-up” individual enterprise-level decisions. Therefore, here we develop a hybrid top-down, bottom-up production consumption model towards intra-national energy transition planning using a decentralized agent-based approach, including a detailed geographic coverage utilizing GIS to map individual energy units. This enables considering SC-level dynamics of end-users pursuing economic objectives subject to regulatory constraints. Two different case studies are reported. The first study reveals that green hydrogen consumption in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu may grow only up to 3% by 2042 from the current nil usage, even with aggressive technological cost reductions and a fixed carbon price of $20/ton CO2, but demand could grow more rapidly if stringent criteria pollutant emissions limits are imposed. In the second case study, which considers natural gas usage across India, the power and city gas sectors are found to be the consistent demand drivers, with their share rising from ∼40% of the total in 2022 to ∼60% by 2032. This is consistent with IEA and IRENA projections. The proposed agent-based model thus provides multiple benefits: It enables the identification of key sectors driving the energy transition; it helps analyze critical factors like resource availability, supply chain infrastructure, and economics; and it can be used to develop decision support tools to investigate clean energy policies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Integrating hydrogen (H2) production systems within natural gas (NG) supply chains can support smoothening transition to cleaner energy resources by utilizing existing infrastructures. This work investigates the dynamic conversion of boil-off gas (BOG) using steam methane reforming (SMR) to produce H2 within liquified natural gas (LNG) process. The study extends beyond technical considerations to encompass a socio-economic approach, exploring optimal H2 allocation to different monetization techniques (e.g., ammonia and methanol) subject to final market price and demand data. Dynamic simulation showed an excellent ability to address the variations in BOG flow, change in LNG temperature and pressure drop within the LNG supply chain, highlighting the need for adaptive flowrate and process setpoints. The H2 productivity and yield are dependent on steam flow rates, steam to carbon ration (S/C) and energy input to the system. Optimizing the reformer temperature is the best practice to enhanced the conversion of BOG to H2. Allocating approximately 74% of the produced H2 to CO2-free ammonia production, and the remainder to methanol via CO2 hydrogenation, achieves an annual profitability of $1.36 billion. However, when considering variable demand and price data over ten years, the model proposes flexible annual H2 allocation to both monetization routes, resulting in an average yearly profitability of $6.84 billion. These findings underscore the importance of integrating interactive simulation approaches to address exogenous and endogenous uncertainties, providing a robust strategy against risks. The comprehensive approach presented in this study contributes to the understanding and strategic planning of H2 production within LNG supply chains, emphasizing adaptability and economic viability in the dynamic landscape of the energy transition. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Road vehicles play an important role in the UK’s energy systems and are a critical component in reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating emissions. A dynamic model of light-duty vehicle fleet, based on predator-prey concepts, is presented. This model is designed to be comprehensive but captures the important features of the competition between types of vehicles on the car market. It allows to predict the evolution of the hydrogen based vehicle’s role in the UK’s vehicle fleet. The model allows to forecast effects of policies, hence to inform policy makers. In particular, it is shown that the transition happens only if the hydrogen supply can absorb at least 350,000 new vehicles per year. In addition to this, the model is used to predict the demand for hydrogen for the passenger vehicle fleet for various scenarios. A key finding of the policy-oriented model is that a successful transition to a clean fleet before 2050 is unlikely without policies designed to fully support the supply chain development. It also shows that the amount of hydrogen required to support a full hydrogen based vehicle fleet is currently not economically viable; the needed infrastructure requires yearly investment larger than £2.5 billions. In order to mitigate these costs, the policy focus should shift from hydrogen based vehicles to hybrid vehicles and range extenders in the transport energy system. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {In the quest for sustainable energy storage technologies, lithium-based batteries, despite their prominence, face limitations such as high costs, safety risks, and supply chain issues. This has propelled the exploration of alternative materials, with aqueous aluminum-ion batteries (AAIBs) emerging as a promising candidate due to their high energy density, abundance, and cost-effectiveness. However, the low equilibrium reduction potential of aluminum ions presents significant challenges, including hydrogen evolution and poor cyclability. Addressing these, the study pioneers the application of single-atom catalysts (SACs) in AAIBs, leveraging their high atom utilization and stability to enhance aluminum deposition and suppress hydrogen evolution. Sn, In, Cu, and Ni SACs are evaluated through density functional theory analysis and experimental validation, with Sn SAC identified as the most effective. Subsequently, the Sn SAC based anode demonstrates enhanced performance, achieving stable cycling over 500 h at 0.5 mA cm−2, significantly improved capacity retention (60 mAh g−1@300 cycles), and rate performance (50 mAh g−1@1 A g−1) in full cell tests. This work underscores the potential of SACs in advancing AAIB technology and opens new pathways for energy storage solutions. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {This paper revisits the economics of manufacturing N-ethylcarbazole (NEC), a strong candidate for large-scale liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC) supply chains, because of its high H2 storage capacity (6 wt%), selective hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, and favorable reaction enthalpy and reaction temperatures compared to other LOHC systems. Two different process routes for producing NEC from industrial chemicals are selected out of 10 possible options: one using aniline and the other using cyclohexanone and nitrobenzene as feedstock. The required capital and operational costs are estimated to determine a NEC break-even cost for a capacity of 225 ktpa. NEC break-even costs of $3.0 and $2.6 per kg LOHC are found for the routes. This is significantly less than the $40/kg cost that has generally been reported in literature for NEC, thus improving the economic viability of using NEC as LOHC. The total fixed capital costs are estimated to be $200 MM and $250 MM. Furthermore, the prices of the feedstock show the largest influence (76% and 72%) on the final NEC break-even costs. The overall LOHC price contribution to the levelized H2 cost is estimated to be $0.77–$0.90 per kg H2 for a 60-day roundtrip and $0.09–$0.10 per kg H2 for a 7-day roundtrip. It is important to note that both routes rely heavily on laboratory scale data and the corresponding assumptions that stem from this limitation. Therefore, this research can serve as a guide to future experimental studies into validating the key assumptions made for this analysis. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Freight transport is critical to the development of the global economy, but it also increases greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, global challenges, such as climate change, must be addressed. Hydrogen-fueled transportation could be a viable, sustainable alternative by providing a clean, efficient, and long-term alternative to fossil fuels, resulting in significantly lower GHG emissions. However, the usage of hydrogen as a fuel is still in its nascent stage, and different nations have initiated strategizing its production and consumption. Understanding the factors that may affect hydrogen's adoption as a fuel in the transportation and logistics sector becomes crucial. The present study attempts to fill this gap by identifying, categorizing, and prioritizing those factors. Initially, the factors have been identified from the literature and further finalized with the consultation with domain experts using the critical success factor theory. Further, relevant factors have been finalized and categorized using exploratory factor analysis. Afterward, the grey–ordinal priority approach is applied to determine the priority weights of the categories and their factors. The findings indicated that operational and environmental are the two most prioritized categories. Specifically, “Substituting Energy Dependency,” “Storage and Infrastructure Costs,” and “Ability to Mitigate Harmful Gases” are the top three prioritized factors for the adoption of hydrogen-fueled transportation among stakeholders. According to the findings, the management of related businesses can collaborate as a business strategy to develop a robust hydrogen supply chain and secure the market stability of hydrogen fuel to ensure sustainable freight transportation. © 2023 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {To achieve a sustainable future, the adoption of renewable energies is crucial. The uneven global distribution of renewable energy necessitates efficient cross-border transportation methods. This study proposes an electricity-hydrogen-methanol-hydrogen-electricity system that utilizes methanol (MeOH) as a renewable energy carrier, facilitating the transport of green energy across borders. Our approach includes Aspen Plus plantwide simulation of MeOH synthesis, MeOH reforming, H2/CO2 separation and purification, and CO2 liquefaction processes. We evaluate each process's material balance, energy consumption, and economic evaluation, encompassing water electrolysis, MeOH/CO2 transportation, and fuel cells electricity generation. Our calculations of current, near future and sustainable future scenarios demonstrate that 10.3–8.5 MWhe of green electricity is required for electrolyzing water to produce 0.196 tonnes of hydrogen, which is then used for synthesizing MeOH (1 tonne). The imported MeOH is reformed in the importing country, recovering 94 % of hydrogen (0.184 tonnes), contributing 2.0–2.9 MWhe of electricity to the grid. The solar and wind supply chains have the CO2 emissions of 575-365 kg/MWhe and 385-257 kg/MWhe respectively. The cost ranges of imported renewable electricity, MeOH and H2 vary depending on the price of exporting renewable electricity, the capital costs, and the operating efficiencies of electrolyzers and fuel cells. These factors contribute to USD 494-106/MWhe for renewable electricity, USD 684-201/t for MeOH and USD 5,199-1,993/t for H2 in the importing countries. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The first scenario relies on domestic demand, involves blue H2 production and storage using steam methane reforming coupled with carbon capture and storage through H2 conversion to hydrogen carriers in liquid form (ammonia and methanol) aligned with the existing infrastructure. The second scenario involves green H2 production from photovoltaic panels as the power source follows by storing H2 in liquid form which is more suitable to export. The findings indicate that the blue H2 system outperforms the green H2 system in terms of energy and exergy, boasting 41.38% and 22.15% compared to 12.16% and 12.75%, respectively. However, when examining economic parameters, the blue H2 system shows a total cost rate of 1976 US$/h, a net profit of $747.2 million (mn) at the end of its lifetime, and a payback period of approximately nine years. Conversely, the green H2 system demonstrates economic indicators of a 125.2 $/h as a total cost rate, $1.26 billion (bn) net profit, and an 8.17 year payback period. Moreover, the production cost rates for blue and green H2 are 1.32 $/kg and 2.55 $/kg, respectively; while the CO2 emissions rate in the blue H2 system is 10.71 kg/s. The green H2 system prevents 19.84 kg/s of CO2 emissions resulted a significant environmental cost reduction of 2.28 $/kg H2.

Two new bus lines were examined and planned to adapt the actual service to a potentially-evolving demand. Electric vehicle types were selected to compare full-electric with hydrogen traction systems. Moreover, particular attention was paid to the energy supply chain through Well-To-Tank analysis. Battery vehicles appear to be preferred, at the moment, when reliance on the national grid is prevailing showing affordable costs 1.8 €/km, ＋0.5 €/km with respect to the actual Diesel operations. However, also hydrogen energy vector resulted a competitive choice. Uncertainty in the market demand plays a great role and if reduced progressively, it allows to recover the heavy investments, given the high cost of ownership of 2.8 €/km.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is among the energy carriers, which are most often considered for bringing about a sustainable energy system. Yet, so far, hydrogen has not delivered as an energy carrier. The core objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art and the future prospects of green hydrogen in the European energy system from economic, energetic and CO2 emissions point-of-view. The analysis shows that there are some increasing opportunities for hydrogen use in industry and in the transport sector, when electrification is not possible or is too expensive, as well as a storage in the European electricity system. However, a hydrogen-based energy system will remain a vision at least over the next decades. The major reason for this is the unfavorable economics mostly due to high investment costs in the whole supply chain. In addition, the overall efficiencies in the hydrogen chains are moderate in general. The full environmental benignity of hydrogen as an energy carrier is only provided when renewable energy sources are used for hydrogen production. However, in Europe, the potentials for green hydrogen are very limited due to the insufficient expansion of renewable electricity generation. For this reason, many European countries are considering options for green hydrogen import. The future of hydrogen is highly dependent on the supporting policy framework. To reduce the risk in the investment in hydrogen infrastructure, as well as to justify the promotion of green hydrogen, it is very important that Europe works out a very clear and realistic long-term implementation strategy. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Three-quarters of the global population lives in the sunbelt region (±35o latitude) with excellent access to solar resources. Wind resources at the equator are very limited, while supply chain and permitting delays are slowing wind deployment at a global scale. This paper investigates the potential for solar photovoltaic-dominant 100% renewable grids to be developed in sunbelt countries through a case study of Malaysia. It was expected that the technical potential for solar photovoltaics and off-river pumped hydro would be far in excess of what is required to decarbonise Malaysia's electricity grids. A Geographic Information System analysis determined that Malaysia has the potential to deploy approximately 8.5 Terawatts of terrestrial photovoltaics and 25 Terawatts of marine floating solar on calm oceans. There are roughly 450 Terawatt-hours of energy storage available in the form of off-river (closed-loop) pumped hydro energy storage. A least-cost, 16-year hourly energy balance model was used to determine that an affluent, fully electrified, highly interconnected Malaysia could greatly reduce emissions through the deployment of 660 Gigawatts of photovoltaics and 2200 Gigawatt-hours of pumped hydro, supported by small amounts of hydrogen-based gas peaking. All-in costs for such a fully decarbonised energy system were modelled to be in the range of 95–103 USD per Megawatt-hour. A Sarawak-Peninsular Malaysia interconnected grid could produce a similar electricity cost to two separate grids while reducing the long-term energy storage needs by approximately 33%. Inclusion of about 3 Terawatt-hours (0.1% of average annual generation at 20 Megawatt-hours/capita/year demand) of hydrogen, synthetic methane, or legacy fossil fuels could further reduce long-term energy storage needs by about 30% by helping to ride through occasional prolonged cloudy periods. Policymakers in sunbelt countries should be highly sceptical of technical potential estimates that suggest limited area for solar photovoltaics. Sunbelt countries can comfortably proceed with the development of cheap, reliable solar-dominant grids primarily supported by pumped hydro energy storage and inter-regional transmission. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The location and quantity of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) play a crucial role in the development and promotion of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs). This study proposes a multi-period urban HRSs site selection and capacity planning with many-objective optimization framework for hydrogen supply chain (HSC). Firstly, the city's multi-period hydrogen requirement is predicted based on a generalized Bass diffusion model. Using publicly available data, including gas station network data, geographic information system (GIS) data, population data, and regional economic data, a spatially aggregated demand model is established to allocate hydrogen requirement at candidate sites in the city of the geographic grid model with a 1 km resolution. On this basis, four interrelated objective functions (total investment cost, hydrogen requirement coverage, risk coefficient, and environmental factors) are developed. The third-generation non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) and the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) are employed to achieve multi-period urban HRSs site selection and capacity planning with many-objective optimization for HSC. By comparing the results of single-objective optimization focusing on minimum cost and maximum hydrogen requirement coverage, it is observed that many-objective optimization achieves a better balance among the four conflicting objectives. After comprehensive analysis, the distribution of HRSs exhibits a clustered structure, influenced by the population and economic structure of the city. In the initial stages of HFCV development, most stations serve the peripheral areas around the city center; while n the later stages of the optimization period, a few high-capacity HRSs begin to concentrate in the city center. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Faced with international climate obligations and domestic pressure, Singapore has recently raised its climate goals significantly. The government had affirmed its intention for carbon emissions to peak before 2030 and for Singapore to attain net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However, as Singapore transitions to green energy, there remains much uncertainty if this transformation, coupled with rapidly evolving geopolitics, would present vulnerabilities to energy security. Hence, this paper is an attempt to investigate Singapore's possible paths to achieve these goals while enhancing energy security in view of present and future energy plans. Key parameters of energy security in Singapore's context are identified to determine how different policy decisions would influence them. The effects of various current and potential policies can thus be evaluated using a systems thinking and system dynamics approach to propose new energy solutions to improve energy security. System dynamics modelling reveals that new energy supply solutions would have to be considered in Singapore's Energy 2050 Plan while furthering efforts in reducing energy demand. Findings reveal that Singapore should have a target of >80% renewable energy by 2050, pursue a central strategy towards sustainable diversification of its energy sources into hydrogen, electricity imports and solar energy and reduce energy consumption. Accordingly, Singapore's energy security can then be improved in terms of the economic, energy supply chain and environmental dimensions, and towards attaining net-zero emissions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The fraudulent mislabelling of seafood geographic origin has been growing due to complex supply chains and growing consumer demand. To address this issue, seafood traceability tools, such as those based on elemental fingerprints (EF) of bivalve shells, have been successfully used to confirm their harvesting location. However, despite the usefulness of these methodologies, there is still room for optimization. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of a routine procedure during bivalve shells preparation for ICP-MS analysis – their pretreatment with H2O2 to remove organic components. More specifically, the present study evaluated the effects of H2O2 on i) the elemental fingerprints of shells of two bivalve species (Ruditapes philippinarum and Cerastoderma edule) from four different locations over the north-western and the western Iberian coast, and ii) their influence on the accuracy of models (based on the EF of shells) used to confirm the geographic origin of these species. Significant differences were observed between untreated and pretreated shells of R. philippinarum (p within location ranging from 0.0001 to 0.0011) and C. edule (p ranging from 0.0001 to 0.0007 for C. edule) for both their elemental fingerprints as a whole and several individual elements. The accuracy of the models employed to determine the origin of the two bivalve species, using i) untreated shells, ii) pretreated shells, and iii) both pretreated and untreated shells grouped per location, was high, with the models accurately predicting the geographic origin of 100, 90 and 95% of R. philippinarum and 95, 100 and 95% of C. edule, respectively. These results show that the shifts in the EF of bivalve shells promoted by treating them with H2O2 prior to ICP-MS analysis did not affect the accuracy of the models used to confirm the geographic origin of both bivalve species. Therefore, the need to pre-treat bivalve shells with H2O2 can be dismissed in future studies addressing the traceability of bivalves when using ICP-MS, thus contributing to reducing environmental impacts and economic costs associated with this procedure, as well as the time required to obtain results. © 2024},

This paper develops a low-carbon scheduling approach for an Integrated Hydrogen Transport and Energy System (IHTES). To reduce carbon emissions, the environmental cost from the hydrogen supply chain network and electric power system is jointly minimized with the operational cost of IHTES. To consider the timeliness of hydrogen deliveries, hydrogen transport via tube trailers is innovatively modeled as an extended vehicle routing problem with time windows, and delays are penalized. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem so that it can be efficiently solved using the branch-and-cut method. Case studies illustrate and validate the proposed model, and demonstrate the computational efficiency of our approach. Carbon emissions are reduced by 47.8% when the emission cost is co-optimized with the operational cost. The operational cost of the hydrogen supply chain network is reduced by 7.3% when the timeliness of hydrogen deliveries is modeled. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Despite its potential, the expansion of offshore wind power faces considerable constraints in offshore power transmission. Hydrogen production derived from offshore wind power emerges as an efficient solution to overcome these limitations and effectively transport energy. This study systematically devises diverse hydrogen energy supply chains tailored to the demands of the transportation and chemical industries, meticulously assessing the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Our findings reveal that the most cost-efficient means of transporting hydrogen to the mainland is through pipelines, particularly when the baseline distance is 50 km and the baseline electricity price is 0.05 USD/kWh. Notably, delivering hydrogen directly to the port via pipelines for chemical industries proves considerably more economical than distributing it to hydrogen refueling stations, with a minimal cost of 3.6 USD/kg. Additionally, we assessed the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) for supply chains that transmit electricity to ports via submarine cables before hydrogen production and subsequent distribution to chemical plants. In comparison to offshore hydrogen production routes, these routes exhibit higher costs and reduced competitiveness. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken to scrutinize the impact of delivery distance and electricity prices on LCOH. The outcomes underscore the acute sensitivity of LCOH to power prices, highlighting the potential for substantial reductions in hydrogen prices through concerted efforts to lower electricity costs. © 2024 by the authors.},

Gray, green and mixed H2 production scenarios were considered. The results show that gray hydrogen reduces 7.1 million tons of CO2, which is half of green hydrogen buses. Replacing diesel fleet at end of lifetime with mixed hydrogen bus fleet was the optimal approach to promote green hydrogen at pump reaching $4/kg in a decade. This gradual transition reduces 62% of the well-to-wheel CO2 emissions of the new bus fleet and creates mass for economies of scale as carbon prices and subsidies cannot promote green hydrogen alone. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This study addresses this gap by applying correlations derived from actual facilities producing grey and blue hydrogen to calculate the CAPEX, while exploring various feedstock combinations for biogas generation to assess the OPEX. The analysis also includes logistic aspects, such as decentralised biogas production and the transportation and storage of CO2. The levelized cost of golden hydrogen is estimated to range from EUR 1.84 to 2.88/kg, compared to EUR 1.47/kg for grey hydrogen and EUR 1.93/kg for blue hydrogen, assuming a natural gas cost of EUR 25/MWh and excluding the CO2 tax. This range increases to between 3.84 and 2.92, with a natural gas cost of EUR 40/MWh with the inclusion of the CO2 tax. A comparison with conventional green hydrogen is performed, highlighting both prices and potential, thereby offering valuable information for decision-making. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The international green hydrogen supply chain (HSC) is anticipated to play a pivotal role in the ongoing energy transition. Our research endeavors to assess the implications of considering fast timescale volatility in renewable energy sources and uncertainties in demand on the design and evaluation of the international green hydrogen supply chain. To achieve this objective, we introduce a comprehensive bi-level optimization method for evaluating the economic viability of the HSC between nations. In the upper level of the optimization, capacity investments are determined using Bayesian optimization and Hyperband (BOHB) for multiple components, including turbines, PV panels, batteries, water electrolyzers, hydrogen liquefaction plants, hydrogen tanks, and liquid hydrogen (LH2) ships. The lower level focuses on the optimal scheduling of LH2 shipments and the operation of each facility, utilizing a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that considers lead time and uncertainties in both supply and demand. We conduct case studies involving nine projects, encompassing three potential import and export countries, to demonstrate and analyze the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Furthermore, we delve into the impacts of various factors, such as economies of scale, lead time, and the minimum operating constraint of the electrolyzer, on the economic performance of the green HSC project. The study also explores the optimal balance between facility installation scales and their relationships with techno-economic parameters, providing valuable insights for future research, technological advancement and supply chain design. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The REpowerEU plan prioritizes combining electrification with low-carbon hydrogen for a green energy shift. However, uncertainties surrounding the future hydrogen market and its supply costs impede the establishment of its value chain. Without definite plans for hydrogen production and infrastructure, investing in low-carbon hydrogen industrial processes is risky. Simultaneously, the absence of solid market interest poses challenges in deploying a hydrogen backbone. In recent years, European gas Transmission System Operators (TSOs) in Belgium, Netherlands, and Germany, have introduced various roadmaps for their prospective national hydrogen network. Despite the infrastructure proposals, detailed quantitative scenario analysis for the future hydrogen supply chain is still missing. This paper presents a hydrogen infrastructure model that employs Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) for investment and operational cost optimization at detailed spatiotemporal resolution. A regionalization method is proposed to allocate the potential hydrogen consumption in different industrial sectors across various clusters within a country, represented as the prospective hydrogen demand nodes. The model assesses extreme supply scenarios to examine the robustness of the resulting network infrastructure and compare the system-levelized cost of hydrogen. A real-life case study focusing on the potential Belgian hydrogen supply chain showcases the model's capabilities and outputs. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is seen as a key energy vector in future energy systems due to its ability to be stored in large volumes for long periods, providing energy flexibility and security. Despite the importance of storage in hydrogen's potential role in a zero-carbon energy system, many techno-economic analyses fail to adequately model different storage methods in hydrogen supply chains, often ignoring storage requirements altogether. Therefore, this paper uses a data-driven techno-economic analysis (TEA) tool to examine the effect of storage size and cost on three different 2030 hydrogen supply chain scenarios: wind-based, solar-based, and mixed-source grid electrolysis. For varying storage sizes and specific capital costs, the overall levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH), including production, storage, and delivery to a constant demand, varies significantly. The LCOH ranges from €3.90–12.40/kgH2, €5.50–12.75/kgH2, and €2.80–15.65/kgH2 for the wind-based, solar-based, and mixed-source grid scenarios respectively, with lower values for scenarios with low-cost storage. This highlights the critical role of low-cost hydrogen storage in realising the energy flexibility and security electrolytic hydrogen can provide. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {For an effective transition from fossil fuel-based energy sources to renewable energy sources, it is crucial to accompany research on the design and optimization of supply chain for new energy sources. The traditional tool for optimizing supply chain management (SCM), the mathematical programming (MP) method, has limitations in terms of computation time and cost as the scale and complexity of the supply chain increase. Therefore, we need a new powerful optimization methodology that enables real-time decision making, considers the interaction among various components within the supply chain, and accommodates the uncertainties in demand and energy supply. In this study, we proposed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) as a new tool to overcome the limitations of MP and satisfy the conditions required for optimizing SCM, as mentioned earlier. Furthermore, we aim to compare a single-agent reinforcement learning (SARL) system with a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) system. Our model achieves successful performance by converging to a value like the optimum of the MP. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {While there is a broad agreement in academia and the business community that hydrogen (H2) could significantly contribute to energy policy goals, there is no single shared vision of a sustainable hydrogen supply chain (HSC). The large number of sources for hydrogen production (various fossil fuels, biomass, water) and the different methods for extracting, distributing, and storing it make creating an efficient supply chain a challenge. The commonly used optimization techniques based on linear programming require a new mathematical problem to be formulated and solved for each case. Instead, this study aims to develop an innovative optimization approach for the hydrogen supply chain that does not require complete knowledge of the end-user hydrogen demand and applies to any region. Based on the Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) method, hybrid Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and Value Sensitive Design (VSD) approach, the integral eco-efficiency indicator constructed by this approach is a weighted linear combination of economic parameters (CAPEX and OPEX) and environmental parameters (ecotoxicity, oxidation potential, eutrophication potential and climate change). The proposed approach has been tested on 22 different hydrogen supply chain options, confirming its efficiency and ability to inform national and international decision-making. For example, a pan-European decision support system could be based on continuously updated data from the EcoInvent database on environmental parameters of hydrogen production, storage, and transport technologies, and updated data on economic parameters from the European Hydrogen Observatory. © 2024 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Green ammonia is poised to be a key part in the hydrogen economy. This paper discusses green ammonia supply chains with a focus on market structures. The architecture of upstream and downstream supply chains is explored. Market structure prototypes in different stages are explored based on transaction cost economics and lessons from the energy industry. In the infancy, a highly vertically integrated structure is proposed to reduce risks and ensure capital recovery. A restructuring towards a disintegrated structure is necessary in the next stage to improve the efficiency. In the late stage, a competitive structure characterized by a separation between asset ownership and production activities and further development of short-term and spot markets are proposed towards a market-driven industry. Mixed structures combining multiple structure features are also discussed due to the dependency on actual conditions. Further, a multi-linear regression model is developed to evaluate the designed structures using a case in the gas industry, due to the commonality in vertical integration and data availability. Results indicate that high asset specificity and uncertainty and low frequency lead to a more disintegrated market structure, and vice versa, thus supporting the structures designed. In addition, evidence from the latest trends in the clean ammonia market also verifies the designed early structure. Besides, potential ways to accelerate market emergence are also discussed. We assume the findings and results contribute to developing green ammonia supply chains and the hydrogen economy. © 2024 The Author},

The survey conducted as part of this study showed that consumers want to eliminate odors, are concerned about potential infections, and generally sort less food waste. This study suggested that the addition of appropriate additives could be a solution. The results indicated that additives could eliminate negative side effects such as unpleasant odors, the presence of insects and rodents, and act as a prevention of the occurrence of pathogenic organisms. Tea tree oil showed the best positive physical and chemical properties among the additives tested (CaCO3 and citric acid) with a significant effect on inhibiting the growth of bacterial strains such as Salmonella strains and had the strongest antibacterial effect, neutralized unpleasant odors, and stabilized the waste. The use of additives could be a future solution to meet consumer demands, improve the quality of food waste and advance the circular economy to improve the sustainability of agricultural systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the sustainability of platinum, designated a “critical raw material” by the European Commission. Platinum has an essential role in automotive catalysts and hydrogen fuel cells, pivotal for the energy transition. This research examines the sustainability of platinum, extending the scope to incorporate social and economic factors, contrary to the predominant tendency of focusing solely on environmental aspects. First, a Material Flow Analysis (MFA) maps the platinum supply chain, identifying critical nodes within it. Second, a sustainability assessment is performed, including an environmental, social, and economic assessment of the supply chain, in order to evaluate the total impact and therefore the sustainability of the use of platinum. The integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with input-output matrices (Environmentally-Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output or EEMRIO method), allows for a regional analysis to locate the main sources of impact. Finally, an equilibrium range for sustainability assessment (ERSA) is proposed to guide European policies, striving for a balance among environmental, social, and economic impacts, particularly comparing primary with secondary production, and primary production outside and inside the EU. The results show that secondary production of platinum causes a substantial drop in CO2-eq emissions (100.9 %) and labour hours (78.9 %), but the costs increase significantly compared to primary production. A balanced approach between primary and secondary production (50–55 % recycling) is recommended to enhance environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The production of platinum in the European Union (EU) results in a 32 % reduction in CO2-eq emissions and 94 % fewer labour hours, but costs increase by 55.2 % compared to production in non-EU countries. The equilibrium range for sustainability assessment (ERSA) would be such that 27–53 % of the total consumption of platinum in EU is produced within EU countries. Knowledge about the platinum supply chain and the environmental, social, and economic impacts produced (in different stages or countries) is fundamental to establishing short- and long-term economic and environmental strategies. © 2024 The Authors},

To secure a reliable and cost-effective supply chain, it is critical to unlock alternative lithium extraction resources beyond conventional brine. In this study, we develop an electrochemical method to directly leach lithium from α-phase spodumene. We find the H2O2 promoter can significantly reduce the leaching potential by facilitating the electron transfer and changing the reaction path. Upon leaching, β-phase spodumene shows a typical phase transformation to HAlSi2O6, while leached α-phase remains its original crystal phase with a lattice shrinkage. To demonstrate the scale-up potential of electrochemical leaching, we design a catalyst-modified high-throughput current collector for high loading of suspended spodumene, achieving a leaching current of 18 mA and a leaching efficiency of 92.2%. Electrochemical leaching will revolutionize traditional leaching and recycling processes by minimizing the environmental footprint and energy consumption. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Continuous growth in the economy has caused an increasing demand for energy resulting in numerous environmental concerns. Despite the popularity gained by renewable energy, certain economic activities still require fossil fuels. Among existing fossil fuels, natural gas (NG) plays a critical role in ensuring Canada’s energy security. However, the Canadian oil and gas sector is a major contributor to national greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, rigorous actions are required within the NG industry to ensure sustainability in its operations. Hydrogen and renewable natural gas (RNG) are identified as low-carbon gaseous fuels capable of decarbonizing the NG supply chain. RNG has already been used in the market, whereas hydrogen is gaining increased attention from utilities due to its ability to produce in higher capacities than RNG. Moreover, hydrogen blending into NG systems is piloted worldwide as an effort to reduce emissions from building heating and other carbon-intensive applications in the energy sector. However, the feasibility of different NG supply chain configurations coupled with low-carbon gaseous fuels is still under question due to multiple economic and environmental factors. Therefore, this study attempts to conduct a cradle-to-grave life cycle environmental and economic assessment of different NG supply chain configurations coupled with hydrogen and RNG. A life cycle thinking-based methodological framework is proposed to evaluate and compare the different supply chain configurations. The framework is presented with a case study for BC’s natural gas sector with six supply chain configurations for the Canadian NG industry. The life cycle environmental and economic performance of the six configurations were evaluated using life cycle assessment and life cycle costing. The performance was integrated using the eco-efficiency analysis tool. According to the study results, replacing RNG with NG is shown to be the most desirable option. However, hydrogen blending with natural gas is still of high cost. Furthermore, the costs and environmental impacts of hydrogen production vary with its production method. Hydrogen production with electrolysis has lower impacts compared to hydrogen production with steam methane reforming (SMR). The findings from this study are geared toward enabling decision-makers and investors to gain a more holistic view of investment decisions related to green energy initiatives in the NG sector. © 2024, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.},

	abstract = {This work evaluates a systematic comparison between the production of methanol and methane using CO2 and renewable hydrogen. CO2 is captured from point and dilute sources using aqueous MEA solutions and a conventional DAC process. Hydrogen is obtained through water electrolysis, powered by PV panels and wind turbines. First, a techno-economic evaluation is developed to detail the characteristics of the production facilities and the renewable energy systems. Finally, a Facility Location Problem (FLP) is developed to determine the centralized and decentralized CO2 use across Spain. This supply network is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, selecting the optimal amount of CO2 to capture, the number and location of the facilities, the distribution of the PV panels for a fixed available area in the territory, and the number of wind turbines across the 47 Spanish peninsular provinces. Methanol is the selected product, with prices between 1,000–2,600 €/tMethanol. MEA solutions are preferred over DAC. Methane production is also considered through decentralized CO2 capture due to abundant CO2 availability and high transportation costs. A sensitivity analysis was performed, obtaining prices from 18.97 to 20.36 €/MMBTU to 8.90–9.09 €/MMBTU in the years 2022 and 2050, covering 5 times the methane production for that period. The implementation of carbon taxes could lower methane prices to around 2–3 €/MMBTU by 2050, aligning closely with natural gas prices. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {An integral part of a successful transition to a carbon-neutral economy requires a significant shift towards renewable energy sources for global energy requirements. Despite a substantial improvement in the current state of the art in renewable energy generation, the bottleneck for their widespread adoption lies in nascent technology related to energy storage. Robust, reliable, and large-scale energy storage is essential to integrate renewable energy sources, which are seasonal and time-dependent, into the global energy supply chain. Underground hydrogen storage (UHS) has received considerable interest as it is a large-scale energy storage system that creates a robust supply chain alongside renewable energy. Although underground hydrogen systems have received increasing attention recently, there is a lack of a broad overview encompassing the primary aspects of UHS projects and implications on the hydrogen economy. In this context, this paper reviews UHS from the standpoint of H2 storage loss through different mechanisms involved in the intermittent storage and retrieval of H2 in the subsurface formation, economic aspects of UHS, and worldwide goals and efforts to promote UHS. Furthermore, the geological structures for UHS are discussed alongside the current status of hydrogen storage projects and transmission pipelines. The global efforts to promote a hydrogen economy are presented through a brief discussion of the announced hydrogen roadmaps and organization initiatives. Finally, this study discusses areas needing further investigation and identifies various barriers to developing UHS projects, which would be helpful for building a thriving hydrogen-based economy in the future. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is envisioned to become a fundamental energy vector for the decarbonization of energy systems. Two key factors that will define the success of hydrogen are its sustainability and competitiveness with alternative solutions. One of the many challenges for the proliferation of hydrogen is the creation of a sustainable supply chain. In this study, a methodology aimed at assessing the economic feasibility of holistic hydrogen supply chains is developed. Based on the designed methodology, a tool which calculates the levelized cost of hydrogen for the different stages of its supply chain: production, transmission & distribution, storage and conversion is proposed. Each stage is evaluated individually, combining relevant technical and economic notions such as learning curves and scaling factors. Subsequently, the findings from each stage are combined to assess the entire supply chain as a whole. The tool is then applied to evaluate case studies of various supply chains, including large-scale remote and small-scale distributed green hydrogen supply chains, as well as conventional steam methane reforming coupled with carbon capture and storage technologies. The results show that both green hydrogen supply chains and conventional methods can achieve a competitive LCOH of around €4/kg in 2030. However, the key contribution of this study is the development of the tool, which provides a foundation for a comprehensive evaluation of hydrogen supply chains that can be continuously improved through the inputs of additional users and further research on one or more of the interconnected stages. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Almost half of the European railways are served by diesel-powered trains used for both cargo and passenger transport. Similar considerations apply to the bus sector in urban and suburban areas. The decarbonization of the transport sector can be achieved by using hydrogen as a fuel for trains and buses. However, the main barrier to adopting hydrogen fuel cell trains and buses is the construction of adequate infrastructure. Thus, to foster a sustainable energy transition, existing renewable plants should be considered when designing new hydrogen supply chains. In the proposed Sicilian case study, existing wind farms are chosen as electricity production plants. Most of them have been shut down due to grid unbalancing issues; still, the curtailed renewable electricity could be used to produce zero-carbon hydrogen via water electrolysis, significantly reducing costs. To account for this opportunity, this study models the hydrogen production, transportation, and refueling stages, employing a mixed-integer linear programming approach to find the optimal location and capacities of hydrogen infrastructure, while minimizing the total daily cost of the supply chain. The model is applied to Sicily and different scenarios for varying hydrogen demands for trains and buses are analyzed and discussed. Results show that capital expenses cover more than 90% of the total cost of the supply chain, with a hydrogen cost dispensed at the filling station ranging from 6.32 to 9.02 €/kgH2. The environmental analysis shows that as hydrogen demand rises, so do the carbon emissions from the distribution stage. However, the impact of using wind-generated electricity in terms of avoided emissions is notably greater. Finally, it is shown that transporting hydrogen in gaseous form using tube trailers is economically more attractive than transportation in liquid form with tanker trucks in the early stages of the network. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Despite global uncertainties, Mexico has become the largest supplier to the United States, emphasizing its growing role in cultivating resilient supply chains. Nearshoring practices from Mexico and Canada to the U.S. present new production opportunities. Increasingly, U.S. consumers place a premium on sustainable consumption, so blue hydrogen plants must be sourced responsibly. This paper firstly goes beyond economic motivations, aiming to formulate a multi-stage methodology for assessing suppliers of municipal solid waste for blue hydrogen plants, marking a pioneering effort in catering to the environmentally conscious preferences of U.S. consumers. The purpose of this work is to examine a case study of Blue Hydrogen production in Nuevo Leon, emphasizing the importance of developing responsible sourcing criteria for waste suppliers to limited blue hydrogen plants. The developed hybrid approach integrates various methodologies, including Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH), fuzzy rough sets, hierarchical fuzzy rough analysis, Fuzzy rough WASPAS, TOPSIS, and Best-Worst Method (BWM), providing a comprehensive framework for decision-making under uncertainty. Key findings include the identification of water conservation (E2) and job creation (S2) as the top environmental and social criteria, respectively. Supplier WC2 was identified as the top-performing waste collector, achieving a final score of 4.77. This structured methodology prioritizes product categories for hydrogen consumption, considering sustainability criteria and U.S. consumer preferences, thereby offering valuable insights for businesses navigating this evolving landscape. © Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is central to meeting the challenge of climate change. The lack of infrastructure to produce, store, and deliver hydrogen is a significant obstacle to transitioning toward a hydrogen economy. For two decades, researchers have been interested in modeling the hydrogen supply chain network to provide managerial insights for decision-makers. We contribute to this research domain by introducing the life cycle optimization (LCO) modeling framework into the hydrogen supply chain network design (HSCND). Specifically, the life cycle costing (LCC) methodology and the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach are integrated through a bi-objective optimization. The two objectives are levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) and global warming potential (GWP) intensity. The problem is solved by implementing an ε-constraint method. The developed LCO framework is applied to a case study in Franche-Comté, France. Results obtained suggest that the introduction of LCC has a major impact on capital costs. The LCA, especially the life cycle inventory (LCI) approach, enables the LCO model to estimate emissions reasonably. The Pareto front obtained by solving the bi-objective model provides a holistic view of turning points. It is concluded that the modeling framework proposed in the paper can provide decision-makers with (i) comprehensive reflection of hydrogen supply network costs; (ii) a detailed description of hydrogen supply chain network-related emissions; and (iii) the quantification and visualization of the trade-off between costs and emissions. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Under scenarios with higher peak demands and greater demand volatility, the LCOH increases to 6.8 EUR/kgH2 due to the need for additional renewable energy capacity. These results highlight the critical impact of electricity availability and demand fluctuations on the LCOH, emphasizing the complex interdependencies within the hydrogen supply chain.

The popularization of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV) requires the deep integration of transportation and energy fields. Considering the complementarity of wind and PV power in remote areas, this paper proposes a planning model of an expressway hydrogen refueling station, including a hydrogen production system (HPS) powered by a wind-PV system and several hydrogen refueling systems (HRSs). The interaction and operation constraints of hydrogen production, storage, delivery, and demand are employed to complete hydrogen supply chain integration in the deterministic planning model. The spatiotemporal distribution of refueling demand at each HRS is obtained by Monte Carlo Simulation. Furthermore, we consider the impact of uncertainty related to renewable energy generation and refueling demand on planning and depict them by ambiguity sets based on Kullback Leibler divergence. The planning problem is transformed into a data-driven distributionally robust model and solved by Value-at-Risk and sample average approximation method. Results indicate that 1) The proposed model can simultaneously collaborate with the segments of the hydrogen supply chain. 2) The proposed method balances the planning reliability and economic efficiency and enhances solution robustness. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study configures a novus multi-objective three-stage supply chain network that aims at optimizing sustainability, resilient and responsive measures, simultaneously. At first, a novel prediction model based on Markov chain, Dempster-Safer evidence theory and Shapely value is developed under trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy ambience to predict the demand of future scenarios. The prediction model prevents undesired loss occurred due to illogical demand consideration. To encounter interval type-2 fuzziness as well as risk in decision making, an unprecedented trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy robust possibilistic programming approach is introduced. The DEcision MAking Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method is suggested in the framework of trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy to prioritize the objective function by scrutinizing the interrelationship among different objective function components. As a result, the subjectiveness in the decision making framework is reduced. The generated configuration is then analysed using a blended approach that merges multi-choice reference goal programming with utility functions and particle swarm optimization. The integrated approach produces high-quality solution in lesser computational time. The insightful explorations are delivered based on a case study of hydrogen fuel supply chain in India. The outcomes show how resilient tactics are quite effective and can significantly enhance social, environmental, and economic aspects. It is determined that the best results for supply chain are obtained when the suggested sustainable, resilience and responsiveness tactics are used jointly. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis results suggest that the objective functions are substantially affected by the responsive level; therefore, managers ought to envisage the trade-off between responsiveness and other objective functions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Furthermore, coordinating the planning of hydrogen storage and battery energy storage systems is incorporated.

More recently, component production by 3Dp has further evolved, permitting more design freedom, lighter structures, quicker prototyping and iteration, supply chain optimization, increased customization and personalization, improved maintenance, repair, overhaul (MRO), and innovation for better materials. 3Dp is particularly relevant to designing better, quicker, and cheaper new components that integrate into more performing systems. Looking ahead, expected developments include the increased scale of 3Dp production, further enhanced performance of components and systems, in-situ manufacturing, and integration with other technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) or the Internet of Things (IoT). From a market perspective, global 3Dp in the aerospace market was valued at USD 1.76–2.66 billion in 2021, with a predicted compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.4–20.23 % over the next few years. Drivers for an even larger CAGR are the expected new developments, such as hydrogen general aviation, urban air mobility (UAM), electrification of aircraft, and hypersonic commercial and military applications. © 2023 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers},

	abstract = {Pipeline transportation is a low-cost option for delivering large volumes of hydrogen (H2), however, the high initial capital cost remains a major impediment to expanding pipeline delivery infrastructure. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of the H2 pipeline on the hydrogen supply chain (HSC), this paper develops an evaluation system for the development potential of the H2 pipeline and simulation models for H2 resource allocation. Furthermore, the HSC system in the southwest of China is used to validate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the levelized cost range of a given 150–550 km H2 pipeline is 2.76–10.12 CNY/kg, which has price advantages over other transportation modes. Compared with the hydrogen supply chain resource allocation (HSCR) model, putting the H2 pipeline into use can optimize the layout and utilization of different transportation modes. It shows that the proportion of H2 transportation volume distribution in H2 pipelines has increased from 0 % to 73.44 %, while the proportion of HLT has first increased from 18.86 % to 54.27 %, and then decreased to 17.95 %. And then under different policy scenarios, the consideration of pipeline reduces the sensitivity of the H2 blending ratio of natural gas (NG) and NG demand to HSC. The impacts of policies on regional H2 development and regional policy implications are revealed. This approach provides a tool for policymakers to quantify the impacts of policy. © 2024 International Energy Initiative},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a promising solution for the decarbonisation of several hard-to-abate end uses, which are mainly in the industrial and transport sectors. The development of an extensive hydrogen delivery infrastructure is essential to effectively activate and deploy a hydrogen economy, connecting production, storage, and demand. This work adopts a mixed-integer linear programming model to study the cost-optimal design of a future hydrogen infrastructure in presence of cross-sectoral hydrogen uses, taking into account spatial and temporal variations, multiple production technologies, and optimised multi-mode transport and storage. The model is applied to a case study in the region of Sicily in Italy, aiming to assess the infrastructural needs to supply the regional demand from transport and industrial sectors and to transfer hydrogen imported from North Africa towards Europe, thus accounting for the region's role as transit point. The analysis integrates multiple production technologies (electrolysis supplied by wind and solar energy, steam reforming with carbon capture) and transport options (compressed hydrogen trucks, liquid hydrogen trucks, pipelines). Results show that the average cost of hydrogen delivered to demand points decreases from 3.75 €/kgH2 to 3.49 €/kgH2 when shifting from mobility-only to cross-sectoral end uses, indicating that the integrated supply chain exploits more efficiently the infrastructural investments. Although pipeline transport emerges as the dominant modality, delivery via compressed hydrogen trucks and liquid hydrogen trucks remains relevant even in scenarios characterised by large hydrogen flows as resulting from cross-sectoral demand, demonstrating that the system competitiveness is maximised through multi-mode integration. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technology plays a crucial role in the pursuit of carbon neutrality. To reduce the cost of carbon neutrality, it is necessary to optimally design the supply chain of CCUS, which leads to mega scale problems for vast countries such as China. In this paper, a novel three-module framework including source-sink matching, meshing, and pipeline transportation network allocating, which has the advantage of plant-level decision and trunk transportation while keeping the size of the model solvable, is proposed. In addition, a database including major CO2 emission sources in thermal power, cement, and iron-steel sectors as well as major CO2 storage sinks in China is set up. By comparison of scenarios with and without offshore storage, offshore storage is found to be superior in those southern coastal provinces. With a transportation distance not exceeding 250 km, around 4.2 Gt of CO2 can be captured and stored. Simultaneously, establishing sensible CCUS deployment objectives is crucial. As the planned deployment capacity rises from 601.8 to 1203.5 Mt/year, the unit net supply chain cost will elevate from 28.5 $/tonCO2 to 36.0 $/ton, marking a 26% increase. Moreover, the evolution of CCUS deployment toward achieving carbon neutrality between 2025 and 2050 is analyzed. Notably, early stage deployment is suitable for provinces in northern China, while other provinces are anticipated to engage in subsequent phases. The comparative study indicates that CCUS is more economically viable than introducing green power and green hydrogen in the thermal power, iron-steel, and cement sectors for emission reduction. © 2024 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {The production of hydrogen-based dense energy carriers (DECs) has been proposed as a combined solution for the storage and dispatch of power generated through intermittent renewables. Frameworks that model and optimize the production, storage, and dispatch of generated energy are important for data-driven decision making in the energy systems space. The proposed multiperiod framework considers the evolution of technology costs under different levels of promotion through research and targeted policies, using the year 2021 as a baseline. Furthermore, carbon credits are included as proposed by the 45Q tax amendment for the capture, sequestration, and utilization of carbon. The implementation of the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework is illustrated through computational case studies to meet set hydrogen demands. The trade-offs between different technology pathways and contributions to system expenditure are elucidated, and promising configurations and technology niches are identified. It is found that while carbon credits can subsidize carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) pathways, substantial reductions in the cost of novel processes are needed to compete with extant technology pathways. Further, research and policy push can reduce the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by upwards of 2 USD/kg. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The global development of electromobility and the innovation of life are becoming increasingly noticeable. A direct implication of this is the increase in demand for modern products and services, their components and thus the raw materials necessary to produce them (e.g. cobalt, lithium, rare earth metals). In the European Union (EU), raw materials related to strategic sectors – renewable energy, electric mobility, defense and aerospace and digital technologies – show a very strong dependence on import throughout the entire value chain. In the case of eleven out of thirty of the so-called critical raw materials (CRM), necessary for the energy transition, the EU’s dependence on import exceeds 85%. Global supply chains, which had already been strained, were further affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the exacerbated geopolitical situations leading to even greater shortages of critical raw materials in Europe and leaving the industry facing challenges in securing access to resources. An implication of this was the European Parliament’s position on critical raw material legislation in September 2023, which called on the EU to increase its processing capacity across the value chain and enable the production of at least 40% of the annual consumption of strategic raw materials by 2030. Growing importance in the transition to a low-emission economy is attributed to cobalt (Co), which is an essential component both in the production of electric vehicles (EV), stationary energy storage and in the developing sectors of wind energy, fuel cell systems and hydrogen storage technolo-gies, robotics, unmanned vehicles (drones) and 3D printing as well as in digital technologies. Securing the supply of such raw material is crucial for the European Union’s economic resilience, technological advantage and strategic autonomy. The purpose of this article is to present and analyze the concept of value chains as strategic models of long-term development and ensuring efficiency from a sustainable perspective. According to the authors, a detailed analysis of value chains may enable defining strategic directions of action and identifying the risks of their disruption or interruption. To give a practical dimension to the presented analyses, the example of the cobalt value chain is provided and the determinants of its functioning on the current market along with development prospects are indicated. © 2024.

	abstract = {Europe's heavy reliance on diesel power for nearly half of its railway lines, for both goods and passengers, has significant implications for carbon emissions. To address this challenge, the European Union advocates for a shift towards hydrogen-based mobility, necessitating the development of robust and cost-effective hydrogen supply chains at regional and national levels. Leveraging renewable energy sources such as wind farms and solid biomass could foster the transition to sustainable hydrogen-based transportation. In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming approach integrated with an external heavy-duty refueling station analysis model is employed to address the optimal design of a new hydrogen supply chain. Through multi-objective optimization, this study aimed to minimize the overall daily costs and emissions of the supply chain. By applying the model to a case study in Sicily, different scenarios with varying supply chain configurations and wind curtailment factors were explored. The findings revealed that increasing the wind curtailment factor from 1% to 2% led to reductions of 12% and 15% in the total daily emission costs and network costs, respectively. Additionally, centralized biomass-based plants dominated hydrogen production, accounting for 96% and 94% of the total production under 1% and 2% wind curtailment factors, respectively. Furthermore, transporting gaseous hydrogen via tube trailers proved more cost effective than using tanker trucks for liquid hydrogen when compressed gaseous hydrogen is required at the dispenser of forecourt refueling stations. Finally, the breakdown of the levelized cost for the hydrogen refuelling station strongly depends on the form of hydrogen received at the gate, namely, liquid or gaseous. Specifically, for the former, the dispenser accounts for 60% of the total cost, whereas for the latter, the compressor is responsible for 58% of the total cost. This study highlights the importance of preliminary and quantitative analyses of new hydrogen supply chains through model-based optimization. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Human and earth system modeling, traditionally centered on the interplay between the energy system and the atmosphere, are facing a paradigm shift. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s mandate for comprehensive, cross-sectoral climate action emphasizes avoiding the vulnerabilities of narrow sectoral approaches. Our study explores the circular bioeconomy, highlighting the intricate interconnections among agriculture, forestry, aquaculture, technological advancements, and ecological recycling. Collectively, these sectors play a pivotal role in supplying essential resources to meet the food, material, and energy needs of a growing global population. We pose the pertinent question of what it takes to integrate these multifaceted sectors into a new era of holistic systems thinking and planning. Results: The foundation for discussion is provided by a novel graphical representation encompassing statistical data on food, materials, energy flows, and circularity. This representation aids in constructing an inventory of technological advancements and climate actions that have the potential to significantly reshape the structure and scale of the economic metabolism in the coming decades. In this context, the three dominant mega-trends—population dynamics, economic developments, and the climate crisis—compel us to address the potential consequences of the identified actions, all of which fall under the four categories of substitution, efficiency, sufficiency, and reliability measures. Substitution and efficiency measures currently dominate systems modeling. Including novel bio-based processes and circularity aspects might require only expanded system boundaries. Conversely, paradigm shifts in systems engineering are expected to center on sufficiency and reliability actions. Effectively assessing the impact of sufficiency measures will necessitate substantial progress in inter- and transdisciplinary collaboration, primarily due to their non-technological nature. In addition, placing emphasis on modeling the reliability and resilience of transformation pathways represents a distinct and emerging frontier that highlights the significance of an integrated network of networks. Conclusions: Existing and emerging circular bioeconomy practices can serve as prime examples of system integration. These practices facilitate the interconnection of complex biomass supply chain networks with other networks encompassing feedstock-independent renewable power, hydrogen, CO2, water, and other biotic, abiotic, and intangible resources. Elevating the prominence of these connectors will empower policymakers to steer the amplification of synergies and mitigation of tradeoffs among systems, sectors, and goals. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Thus, this paper assess the energy efficiency and the cost of a green hydrogen supply from well to tank exemplified for fuel cell heavy-duty vehicles in Germany related to the years 2030 and 2050. Therefore, compressed gaseous hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, methanol and ammonia are considered and different hydrogen production regions in North and Central Germany, as well as an import from Tunisia and Argentina (Patagonia) are assumed. The assessment shows that a hydrogen supply chain in its state of aggregation as finally demanded is the lowest cost option leading to 700 bar compressed gaseous hydrogen filling costs of 5 €2020/kgH2 in 2030 and 4 €2020/kgH2 in 2050 and liquid hydrogen filling costs around 7 €2020/kgH2 in 2030 and 6 €2020/kgH2 in 2050. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The results show that the phase change temperature of DSSNK5-SAP is 7.71 °C, and its latent heat value is 122.1 J g−1, which remains unchanged after 50 cycles. Compared with pure DHPD, the supercooling degree of DSSNK5-SAP is reduced to 3 °C, and the thermal conductivity is 1.5 times that of DHPD. In addition, the crystal structure and chemical compatibility of DSSNK5-SAP were analyzed, and the regulation mechanism of auxiliaries and SAP on the phase change behavior of EHS was described. The cold energy storage/release and transient response performance of DSSNK5-SAP were tested, and the application experiment of fruit preservation was also carried out. As a result, DSSNK5-SAP can make the fruit have a good fresh-keeping effect, which proves its considerable application potential in cold chain transportation. It reduces the cost of cold chain transportation from the root and contributes to the stable development of the city and society. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

First, the k-shorted path method is introduced to analyze HFCV refueling load considering vehicle travel habits and routing diversity. Second, based on it, a two-stage integrated planning model is established to minimize the total investment and operation cost. The construction of hydrogen refueling stations, electrolysis-based hydrogen generation stations and hydrogen pipelines are coordinated with their operating constraints, constituting the green hydrogen supply chain, in which hydrogen storage is also an important part for consideration to address variable renewable power. Then, the proposed model is reformulated as a mixed integer linear programing (MILP) problem solved efficiently. Finally, the case studies are carried out on an urban area in Xi'an China to verify the validity and correctness of the proposed method. The results show that the integrated planning can realize synergy benefits. The influence of electricity prices and k values is also discussed. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Plastic waste management is an area of concern globally, given the accumulation of plastics in landfills and the natural environment. Gasification can convert mixed plastic waste (MPW) to synthesis gas (syngas), a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2), which can be further converted to commodity chemicals. In this work, we present techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) for two gasification pathways that produce methanol and hydrogen from MPW feedstock. In particular, we modeled the gasifier as a dual fluidized bed reactor for MPW gasification in a greenfield, standalone facility. Our analysis indicates that the minimum selling price (MSP) of methanol and hydrogen produced by MPW gasification is $0.70 kg−1 and $3.41 kg−1, respectively. For comparison, we also evaluate the production of methanol and hydrogen from municipal solid waste. For MPW gasification processes, the syngas yield (kg syngas per kg plastic) and waste plastic feedstock price have the largest impact on MSP. Waste plastic feedstock prices of <$0.02 kg−1 can enable MPW-based processes to achieve cost parity with existing fossil-fuel-derived pathways. Additionally, LCA indicates that methanol and hydrogen produced from MPW gasification can reduce the total supply chain energy use by 52% and 56% respectively when compared with fossil-fuel-derived pathways. However, the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from MPW-gasification pathways are estimated to increase by 166% and 36% for methanol and hydrogen, respectively, compared to their current production pathways. Due to the co-product credit of steam and electricity export, MPW gasification pathways have lower levels of smog formation, acidification, non-carcinogenics, ozone depletion, eutrophication and particulates than the respective incumbent processes. Since waste streams are the feedstocks in this study, no energy burden was assigned to the upstream processes. Overall, this work identifies syngas yield and waste plastic feedstock price as the two critical variables with the largest impact on the MSP of products produced by MPW gasification. The outcomes of this work can help guide future research in MPW gasification. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The most challenging aspect of developing a green hydrogen economy is long-distance oceanic transportation. Hydrogen liquefaction is a transportation alternative. However, the cost and energy consumption for liquefaction is currently prohibitively high, creating a major barrier to hydrogen supply chains. This paper proposes using solid nitrogen or oxygen as a medium for recycling cold energy across the hydrogen liquefaction supply chain. When a liquid hydrogen (LH2) carrier reaches its destination, the regasification process of the hydrogen produces solid nitrogen or oxygen. The solid nitrogen or oxygen is then transported in the LH2 carrier back to the hydrogen liquefaction facility and used to reduce the energy consumption cooling gaseous hydrogen. As a result, the energy required to liquefy hydrogen can be reduced by 25.4% using N2 and 27.3% using O2. Solid air hydrogen liquefaction (SAHL) can be the missing link for implementing a global hydrogen economy. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The transport sector is experiencing a massive transformation by detaching itself from fossil fuels, resulting in more entanglement and competition among various technologies across the entire supply chain. Unfortunately, solely relying on the electrification of transportation will not be adequate to de-fossilize the whole transport sector; therefore, consuming emission-free alternative fuels will be required. Furthermore, the intermittency of renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar) demands extensive investment in energy storage technologies. Thus, this study investigates the mutual impact and the synergy between energy storage technologies and bioenergy in providing flexibility for the German transport sector. To this end, we develop an extended version of the bioenergy optimization model (BENOPTex) that regards various biofuel and synthetic fuel technologies while considering the possibility of storing renewable electricity using utility-scale battery energy storage systems (BESS) in order to achieve low-emission targets set by policymakers. The optimization model maximizes the greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement level until 2050 for various settings, while reporting the total system cost of the respective strategies. Finally, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the results and exhibit the significance of energy vectors in improving the system's flexibility. Although BESS can improve the GHG abatement level, their exorbitant storage costs make them economically infeasible without considering the intermittency of renewable sources. To make this technology more viable, alternative business strategies must be pursued, such as leveraging the storage capacity of electric vehicles. However, when renewable sources' variability necessitates electricity storage, our optimization model uses stored electricity to produce hydrogen. The outcomes can provide insights for policymakers in developing effective investment strategies.  © 2023 IEEE.},

This paper examines available net-zero carbon technologies that these EITE industries could potentially adopt to achieve decarbonization targets. The key technologies identified are hydrogen, carbon capture and digitalization. Additionally, we identify continued innovation policy and support to promote the growth and prosperity of a low-carbon supply chain, BC's industrial competitiveness, and the scale-up of renewable companies and infrastructure. To aid public and private sectors in striving for sustainable pathways to decarbonization, we have developed a Technology Roadmap for BC to help policymakers and firms formulate a climate change mitigation strategy employing innovative technologies for large industrial emitters.

The main drawback that still hinders its deployment is its high cost, as well as critical operational issues related to the entire supply chain, both for safety and efficiency reasons. Incentives and certification schemes are needed to support the green hydrogen. In this paper, with the aim to identify the green hydrogen supply chain and associated costs, an energy hub with electricity and hydrogen demands has been studied comparing the centralized green hydrogen production and distribution via trucks, against the installation of an on-site green hydrogen production plant made up of renewable power generation, an electricity storage system, and an electrolyzer. The problem was modeled and solved as a MILP optimization in MATLAB environment. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis on the cost was carried out, which showed that even if the truck transportation cost for hydrogen is set at 0 a/kg, it is still more cost-effective to install an on-site electrolyzer to produce the required hydrogen. © 2023 IEEE.},

This paper aims to address this by developing a flexible techno-economic analysis (TEA) tool that can be used to evaluate the potential of future scenarios where hydrogen is produced, stored, and distributed within a region. The tool takes a full year of hourly data for renewables availability and dispatch down (the sum of curtailment and constraint), wholesale electricity market prices, and hydrogen demand, as well as other user-defined inputs, and sizes electrolyser capacity in order to minimise cost. The model is applied to a number of case studies on the island of Ireland, which includes Ireland and Northern Ireland. For the scenarios analysed, the overall LCOH ranges from €2.75–3.95/kgH2. Higher costs for scenarios without access to geological storage indicate the importance of cost-effective storage to allow flexible hydrogen production to reduce electricity costs whilst consistently meeting a set demand. © 2023 The Authors},

This study investigates the role of liquid hydrogen (LH2) in a national, greenhouse gas-neutral energy supply system for Germany in 2045. The integrated energy system model suite ETHOS is extended by LH2 demand profiles in the sectors aviation, mobility, and chemical industry and means of LH2 transportation via inland vessel, rail, and truck. This case study demonstrates that the type of hydrogen demand (liquid or gaseous) can strongly affect the cost-optimal design of the future energy system. When LH2 demand is introduced to the energy system, LH2 import, transportation, and production grow in importance. This decreases the need for gaseous hydrogen (GH2) pipelines and affects the location of H2 production plants. When identifying no-regret measures, it must be considered, that the largest H2 consumers are the ones with the highest readiness to use LH2. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {This article challenges the view that zero carbon hydrogen from steam methane reforming (SMR) is prohibitively expensive and that the cost of CO2 capture increases exponentially as residual emissions approach zero; a flawed narrative often eliminating SMR produced hydrogen as a route to net zero. We show that the capture and geological storage of 100% of the fossil CO2 produced in a SMR is achievable with commercially available post-combustion capture technology and an open art solvent. The Levelised Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) of 69£/MWhth HHV (2.7£/kg) for UK production remains competitive to other forms of low carbon hydrogen, but retains a hydrogen lifecycle carbon intensity of 5 gCO2e/MJ (LHV) due to natural gas supply chain and embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Compensating for the remaining lifecycle GHG emissions via Direct Air Capture with geological CO2 Storage (DACCS) increases the LCOH to 71–86 £/MWhth HHV (+3–25%) for a cost estimate of 100–1000 £/tCO2 for DACCS and the 2022 UK natural gas supply chain methane emission rates. Finally, we put in perspective the cost of CO2 avoidance of fuel switching from natural gas to hydrogen with long term price estimates for natural gas use and DACCS, and hydrogen produced from electrolysis. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, it will be necessary to introduce renewable energy for electricity and heat supply, and in 2021 the share of renewable energy in Japan will be about 22.4 %. Therefore, this study examines the feasibility of supplying energy to Hakodate City through offshore wind power with a rating of 722 MW, which is planned off the coast of Hiyama in southern Hokkaido, and onshore wind power with a rating of 160 MW, which is planned in the southeastern part of Hakodate City. The proposed system will transmit the power output from the wind farm to a substation near Hakodate via a transmission line. The transmitted power is then used to supply power via transmission lines in accordance with the power load. Any surplus power is stored in storage batteries and hydrogen gas. When the power supply is insufficient, the power from the storage batteries and hydrogen gas are used to stabilize the power supply using fuel cells. Using this system, more than 90 % of Hakodate's energy supply can be supplied. However, this analysis was conducted because it is important to reduce the total storage battery capacity in order to reduce costs. The analysis method compared the use of stored electricity and hydrogen with the use of electricity from storage batteries or hydrogen gas in the event of electricity supply shortages. This comparison can be used to determine whether more hydrogen tank capacity or storage battery capacity should be installed. As a result, it is thought that reducing the total storage battery capacity and increasing the hydrogen tank capacity by giving priority to the use of electricity stored in storage batteries will result in a system with lower costs and a higher supply ratio. Since the system will be profitable in the sixth year and the payback period will be 7.6 years, the feasibility of this system is considered to be high. The supply ratio exceeds 90 % when the storage battery ratio is 10 % or more, and the maximum supply ratio is reached when the storage battery ratio is around 25 %, so it is optimal to keep the storage battery ratio between 10 % and 25 %.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to its abundance and relatively low cost, natural gas will continue to be a common feedstock for methanol production, at least in the near to medium term. The present work focuses on natural gas pyrolysis in a catalytic liquid metal bubble reactor, combined with CO2 utilization, as an alternative to traditional steam reforming processes. The pyrolysis reactor consists of multiple vertical tubes filled with molten Cu0.45Bi0.55 alloy and heated in the radiant zone of a fired heater. The reactor geometry and operating conditions are optimized by rigorously accounting for the coupling of bubble flow hydrodynamics with the catalytic and non-catalytic kinetics of methane pyrolysis in molten metals. Pyrolysis generates hydrogen and solid carbon, which rise first through the liquid metal and then through a layer of molten salt (e.g., NaBr) whose purpose is to minimize the loss of liquid metal entrained with the carbon. The carbon forms a recoverable layer above the salt, and the hydrogen reacts with captured CO2 in a separate methanol synthesis reactor. The cradle-to-gate and cradle-to-grave CO2 emissions are 0.074 and 1.45 t CO2-eq/t methanol, respectively, for median supply chain emissions of natural gas and captured CO2. This is a lower carbon footprint than other practical pyrolysis and steam methane reforming processes. Negative cradle-to-gate CO2 emissions are achievable if natural gas and captured CO2 are sourced from supply chains with low emissions. The estimated carbon production cost of $0.27/kg is well below the recent market price of carbon black in the United States. The production cost of carbon is most sensitive to the fixed capital investment of the plant, the captured CO2 cost, the natural gas and methanol costs, and the discount rate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Urban population and the trend towards online commerce leads to an increase in delivery solution in cities. The growth of the transport sector is very harmful to the environment, being responsible for approximately 40% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. The problem is aggravated when transporting perishable foodstuffs, as the vehicle propulsion engine (VPE) must power not only the vehicle but also the refrigeration unit. This means that the VPE must be running continuously, both on the road and stationary (during delivery), as the cold chain must be preserved. The result is costly (high fuel consumption) and harmful to the environment. At present, refrigerated transport does not support full-electric solutions, due to the high energy consumption required, which motivates the work presented in this article. It presents a turnkey solution of a hydrogen-powered refrigeration system (HPRS) to be integrated into standard light trucks and vans for short-distance food transport and delivery. The proposed solution combines an air-cooled polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), a lithium-ion battery and low-weight pressurised hydrogen cylinders to minimise cost and increase autonomy and energy density. In addition, for its implementation and integration, all the acquisition, power and control electronics necessary for its correct management have been developed. Similarly, an energy management system (EMS) has been developed to ensure continuity and safety in the operation of the electrical system during the working day, while maximizing both the available output power and lifetime of the PEMFC. Experimental results on a real refrigerated light truck provide more than 4 h of autonomy in intensive intercity driving profiles, which can be increased, if necessary, by simply increasing the pressure of the stored hydrogen from the current 200 bar to whatever is required. The correct operation of the entire HPRS has been experimentally validated in terms of functionality, autonomy and safety; with fuel savings of more than 10% and more than 3650 kg of CO2/year avoided. © 2023 The Author(s)},

Primary among these is the steel industry, a cornerstone of the European economy and industry. With the emergence of new hydrogen-based steelmaking options, particularly through hydrogen direct reduction, the structure of global steel production and supply chains will transition from being based on low-cost coal resources to that based on low-cost electricity and therefore hydrogen production. This study examines the techno-economic options for three European countries of Germany, Spain, and Finland under five different steel supply chain configurations compared to local production. Results suggest that the high costs of hydrogen transportation make a European steelmaking supply chain cost competitive to steel produced with imported hydrogen, with local production costs ranging from 465 to 545 €/t of crude steel (CS) and 380–494 €/tCS for 2030 and 2040, respectively. Conversely, imports of hot briquetted iron and crude steel from Morocco become economically competitive with European supply chains. Given the capital and energy intensive nature of the steel industry, critical investment decisions are required in this decade, and this research serves to provide a deeper understanding of supply chain options for Europe. © 2023 The Authors},

While its applicability across various sectors is undeniable, its integration into established energy systems presents multifaceted challenges. This study investigates the complexities of integrating hydrogen into the Netherlands' energy systems. Beyond technological advancements, the successful design and rollout of a hydrogen supply chain require coordination and collaboration among a myriad of stakeholders. Through a mixed-methods approach, this study combines findings from a broad literature review, policy document analyses, evaluation of 59 field projects, and engaging dialogues with 33 key stakeholders from different sectors. This investigation led to the identification and categorization of key players in the Dutch hydrogen sector, revealing their interconnected roles and the challenges encountered in the hydrogen integration process. The study further categorized the identified challenges faced by stakeholders into five core domains: technical, infrastructural (including supply chain), socioeconomic, environmental, and institutional, with associated factors. Prominent challenges include transportation infrastructure upgrades, high initial costs and scalability, effective storage methods, safety and cybersecurity measures, storage and distribution infrastructure, security of supply, and public acceptance. This study contributes to the hydrogen integration discourse, offering insights for academics, industry, and policymakers. Its detailed stakeholder analysis, holistic categorization of challenges across five domains, and a stakeholder-centric approach grounded in real-world dialogues offer applicable frameworks beyond its primary context. In this vein, it guides future research and decisions, and its approach is adaptable for different regions or sectors, emphasizing comprehensive transition strategies. © 2023 The Authors},

Each configuration has a cost minimization target. The concept of value of stochastic solution (VSS) is used to evaluate the stochastic optimization results and compare them to their deterministic counterpart.

In this context, hydrogen has been identified as an alternative energy carrier to decarbonize the energy sector. Thus, this study proposes a mathematical decision-making model to identify the minimum cost of establishing the hydrogen supply chain. The proposed model is developed by considering various echelons in the hydrogen supply chain such as conditioning, storage, transportation, and distribution. The model developed in this work is demonstrated using two scenarios. The two scenarios analyzed the techno-economic feasibility of the supply chain for three different end users of hydrogen. These end users are oil refinery industries, power plants, and hydrogen refueling stations. The first scenario assumes that the pipeline’s installation cost is paid by the operator. In the second scenario, the pipeline installation cost was fractionated to explore the impact of cost sharing among the stakeholders. Liquefaction, cryogenic liquid tanks, tankers, and railway tankers were selected in the optimal supply chain for oil refinery industries and power plants. For refueling stations, the optimal supply chain consisted of compression, a high-pressure vessel, a tube trailer, and a railway tube car. Moreover, it was found that the distance and hydrogen demand were the two most significant deciding factors in both scenarios. This led to liquefied hydrogen being chosen as a form of delivery for oil refineries and power plants and gaseous hydrogen for refueling stations. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

We applied an interview study approach conducting semi-structured interviews with 13 experts from hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and utilization. This research shows that the industry background and the engagement intentions of actors, as well as political funding programs, strongly influence the choice of governance mechanisms to coordinate the scaling up of hydrogen supply chains. While formal governance mechanisms are mainly used for economic safeguarding, informal mechanisms enable the tremendous level of collective learning necessary for the scaling up of hydrogen supply chains. Novel theoretical and managerial insights are provided regarding the influence of governance mechanisms on the scaling up process and showing the importance of collective learning when building hydrogen supply chains. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is now being seen as one of the most promising carbon-free and abundant energy sources on the path to net-zero emissions. However, high transportation, storage, and carbon emission costs in hydrogen supply chains are critical economic barriers that hinder the development of the hydrogen economy. Consequently, hydrogen refuelling stations have to face a trade-off between self-produced and purchased hydrogen quantities while considering transportation and storage costs. Furthermore, hydrogen manufacturers and refuelling stations have to make a trade-off between their hydrogen outputs and carbon emission reduction quantities under a cap-and-trade policy. We develop a differential game model that draws on and extends the literature on hydrogen supply chain design and operation to address this dual dilemma. Therein, state variables include the hydrogen retail price and carbon emission trading price, and control variables involve the hydrogen outputs and carbon emission reduction amounts of the hydrogen manufacturer and refuelling station. We use the feedback control technique to find optimal solutions and implement numerical simulations to validate solutions and the sensitivity of parameters. The results suggest that carbon emission reduction efficiency, hydrogen wholesale price, and carbon trading reference price significantly impact the optimal decisions of production plans and carbon emission reduction. This study may provide theoretical guidance for promoting hydrogen utilisation, cost reduction and low-carbon development. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

The province of Córdoba is an excellent model case for the study of the rapid incorporation of hydrogen as fuel, to replace 20% V/V of natural gas consumed in vehicular use. This does not involve major changes in infrastructure or modifications to the vehicles. This paper computes and analyzes the levelized cost of hydrogen with the emissions associated for each part of the complete hydrogen supply chain. Two different production sources were used: renewable energies sources and the Argentine electrical grid; and two production pathways: in situ and centralized production. Comparing the same volume of proposed hydrogen compressed natural gas and current CNG, a cost decrease in the majority of the scenarios and a CO2eq emission reduction ranging from 19.5 to 8.2% are achieved, even if the hydrogen is produced using the carbon-intensive grid electricity. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

It requires efficient and integrated technological solutions that enable system-wide gains via a whole-of-system approach. Here, we create a solid link between the manufacturing of an iron salt, its application in an urban water system, and high-quality bioenergy recovery from wastewater. An iron-oxidising electrochemical cell is used to remove CO2 (also H2S and NH3) from biogas, thus achieving biogas upgrading, and simultaneously producing FeCO3. The subsequent dose of the electrochemically produced FeCO3 to wastewater and sludge removes sulfide and phosphate, and enhances sludge settleability and dewaterability, with comparable or superior performance compared to the imported and hazardous iron salts it substitutes (FeCl2, and FeCl3). The process enables water utilities to establish a self-reliant and more secure supply chain to meet its demand for iron salts, at lower economic and environmental costs, and simultaneously achieve recovery of high-quality bioenergy. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {With the increasing integration of traditional electric vehicles (EVs), the ensuing congestion and overloading issues have threatened the reliability of power grid operations. Hydrogen has been advocated as a promising energy carrier to achieve low-carbon transportation and energy (trans-energy) systems, which can support the popularization of fuel-cell hybrid EVs (FCHEVs) while enhancing the flexibility of power grids. In this paper, we propose an optimal scheduling framework for trans-energy systems that evaluates the merits of the hydrogen supply chain from water electrolysis, compressed storage and transportation to FCHEV utilization. A detailed FCHEV model is established, and mileage is modeled as a function of the stored electricity and hydrogen mass. A stochastic programming-based scheduling model is formulated, which minimizes the total cost of unit commitment and the hydrogen supply chain. The Dijkstra algorithm is adopted to search the shortest path for hydrogen transportation. Case studies demonstrate that FCHEVs can reduce the operational costs of tran-energy systems and facilitate the accommodation of renewable energy when compared to traditional EVs.  © 2015 CSEE.},

	abstract = {Import and export of fossil energy carriers are cornerstones of energy systems world-wide. If energy systems are to become climate neutral and sustainable, fossil carriers need to be substituted with carbon neutral alternatives or electrified if possible. We investigate synthetic chemical energy carriers, hydrogen, methane, methanol, ammonia and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, produced using electricity from Renewable Energy Source (RES) as fossil substitutes. RES potentials are obtained from GIS-analysis and hourly resolved time-series are derived using reanalysis weather data. We model the sourcing of feedstock chemicals, synthesis and transport along nine different Energy Supply Chains to Germany and compare import options for seven locations around the world against each other and with domestically sourced alternatives on the basis of their respective cost per unit of hydrogen and energy delivered. We find that for each type of chemical energy carrier, there is an import option with lower costs compared to domestic production in Germany. No single exporting country or energy carrier has a unique cost advantage, since for each energy carrier and country there are cost-competitive alternatives. This allows exporter and infrastructure decisions to be made based on other criteria than energy and cost. The lowest cost means for importing of energy and hydrogen are by hydrogen pipeline from Denmark, Spain and Western Asia and Northern Africa starting at 36 EUR/MWhLHV to 42 EUR/MWhLHV or 1.0 EUR/kgH2 to 1.3 EUR/kgH2 (in 2050, assuming 5% p.a. capital cost). For complex energy carriers derived from hydrogen like methane, ammonia, methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuels, imports from Argentina by ship to Germany are lower cost than closer exporters in the European Union or Western Asia and Northern Africa. For meeting hydrogen demand, direct hydrogen imports are more attractive than indirect routes using methane, methanol or ammonia imports and subsequent decomposition to hydrogen because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses of the indirect routes.

	abstract = {Energy companies are considering producing renewable fuels such as hydrogen/ammonia. Setting up a production network means deciding where to build production plants, and how to operate them at minimum electricity and transport costs. These decisions are complicated by many factors including the difficulty in obtaining accurate current data (e.g., electricity price and transport costs) for potential supply locations, the accuracy of data predictions (e.g., for demand and costs), and the need for some decisions to be made due to external (not modelled) factors. Thus, decision-makers need access to a user-centric decision system that helps them visualise, explore, interact and compare the many possible solutions of many different scenarios. This paper describes the system we have built to support our energy partner in making such decisions, and shows the advantages of having a graphical user-focused interactive tool, and of using a high-level constraint modelling language (MiniZinc) to implement the underlying model. © Matthias Klapperstueck, Frits de Nijs, Ilankaikone Senthooran, Jack Lee-Kopij, Maria Garcia de la Banda, and Michael Wybrow.},

Many processes use process gases that have significant embodied energy.

To this end, Edwards is developing a Hydrogen Recovery System (HRS) capable of recovering EUV process waste hydrogen gas. The HRS purifies and pressurizes the waste hydrogen to meet purity & pressure requirements and recycles the gas directly into the EUV lithography tool. In partnership with imec, Edwards has demonstrated successful recycling into the ASML NXE:3400B EUV scanner installed at imec. Over 9 million standard liters (approximately 850 kg) of hydrogen have recycled with no negative impact to the performance of the EUV scanner, while reducing EUV-related hydrogen consumption approximately 70%.

	abstract = {The desire to decarbonize modern energy is challenged by the indispensable use of fossil fuels. Circular economy (CE) represents a promising shift in the modern industry from linear toward a self-sustaining circular system where the synergy among various industries formulates a closed loop. Addressing the end-of-life waste hierarchy, this work evaluates the integration of biomass conversion technology as a potential strategy to empower circularity in the oil and gas (O&G) industry. Decision problems associated with technology selection and facility location are resolved using a systematic analytical approach (e.g., principal component analysis, multi-objective decision-making, mixed-integer linear programming, geospatial information, etc.), which are modeled into two parts: (i) optimal biomass conversion pathway synthesis and (ii) optimal supply chain synthesis. The performance of the determined optimal solutions in terms of economic and environmental aspects is evaluated in the model, which is then benchmarked with that of the conventional O&G design. A case study in Malaysia is adopted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in determining the optimal technology pathway and supply chain. The model favors hydrogen production through gasification with promising environmental (1.32 kg CO2/kg H2) and economic performance ($1.09 /kg H2). Ultimately, the proposed strategy represents a preliminary stage design which serves as a direction for policymakers, investors, and researchers to strive toward CE goals. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) is a clean energy carrier and has recently gained significant attention. Efforts are being made to promote liquid hydrogen (LH2) owing to its long-time storage, transportation, and high-purity end-use requirements. LH2 storage and regasification is an essential step in the H2 supply chain. This study proposes a novel integrated energy system that produces liquefied natural gas (LNG), natural gas liquids (NGL), and liquid helium (LHe) utilizing the cold energy of LH2. A well-known process simulation software (Aspen Hysys® v11) is employed to simulate the integrated process. The optimal design variables are found through the Aspen Hysys® built-in Mixed optimization technique. The optimal design shows a specific energy consumption of 0.347 kWh/kg with exergy destruction of 43.3 MW. The required volume of the spherical tank for LH2 storage is 6.3 m3. The results of the lifecycle cost analysis show that the Levelized cost of producing LNG, NGL, and LHe is 0.50 USD/kg, 0.56 USD/kg, and 98.0 USD/kg, respectively. The conclusion of this study suggests that the proposed process can improve the overall H2 supply chain by effectively utilizing LH2 for LNG, NGL, and LHe production. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

From 2026 to 2030, ASEAN could shift to blue hydrogen energy exports with the help of carbon capture, utilization, and storage. However, the domestic applications of hydrogen energy will remain economically uncompetitive in most ASEAN countries. After 2030, as the levelized costs of electricity for renewables decline and the share of renewable energy power increases, the cost of hydrogen energy production from surplus electricity could become even lower.

However, currently most analyses of carbon neutral scenarios are based on solving for macroeconomic costs and optimal energy sharing. However, it remains unclear how the contribution of energy from each of the various technologies and their interactions, change over time. To address this, this study presents an improved “Glocal” Century Energy Environment Planning (G-CEEP) model, with embedded energy technology modules, evaluate different mitigation pathways. The approach introduced here provides a more nuanced understanding of how a broad range of measures can be evaluated at each step. Based on these findings, although it may be challenging, communities can achieve carbon neutrality by using different measures during different stages. Interestingly, although there is consensus that renewable energy sources contribute the most to decarbonization, communities need to engage in discussion about how to utilize renewable energy. Furthermore, imported energy sources could become the dominant clean energy source for 2022–2028, providing a transition between low-cost on-site energy sources and high-cost technologies based on biomass and hydrogen. And implementation of hydrogen- and biomass- based sources requires the window period for establishing a supply chain and reducing costs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the rising threat of climate change, green hydrogen is increasingly seen as the high-capacity energy storage and transport medium of the future. This creates an opportunity for low- and middle-income countries to leverage their high renewable energy potential to produce, use, and export low-cost green hydrogen, creating environmental and economic development benefits. While identifying ideal locations for green hydrogen production is critical for countries when defining their green hydrogen strategies, there has been a paucity of adequate geospatial planning approaches suitable to low- and middle-income countries. It is essential for these countries to identify green hydrogen production sites which match demand to expected use cases such that their strategies are economically sustainable. This paper therefore develops a novel geospatial cost modelling method to optimize the location of green hydrogen production across different use cases, with a focus on suitability to low- and middle-income countries. This method is applied in Kenya to investigate the potential hydrogen supply chain for three use cases: ammonia-based fertilizer, freight transport, and export. We find hydrogen production costs of €3.7–9.9/kgH are currently achievable across Kenya, depending on the production location chosen. The cheapest production locations are identified to the south and south-east of Lake Turkana. We show that ammonia produced in Kenya can be cost-competitive given the current energy crisis and that Kenya could export hydrogen to Rotterdam with costs of €7/kgH, undercutting current market prices regardless of the carrier medium. With expected techno-economic improvements, hydrogen production costs across Kenya could drop to €1.8–3.0/kgH by 2030. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The potential future use of hydrogen as transportation fuel should be assessed from supply chain point. However, the main challenge to motivate hydrogen supply chain (HSC) network is the insufficiency of the present hydrogen infrastructure. This paper presents a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model for a rational HSC design, given that primary energy source availability, production technologies, transportation modes and storage types. A sustainable principle based on Markov chain is innovatively introduced in the design of HSC network. The strategic decisions for sustainability infrastructure plans can be hierarchically analyzed in time-associated steps (2025–2030–2035). Meanwhile the spatiotemporal-resolved design is further used for an explicit consideration of specific city (Dalian in China), not heavily focused on national/country scale. Furthermore, optimizations are evaluated with total daily costs, carbon tax and CO2 emissions reduction constraints. The results show that the route of WE(S2)→WE(S2)→WE(S3) is the strategic decisions for Dalian hydrogen infrastructure plan from economic-environmental sustainable viewpoint, with the whole HSC costs of 18.44 $ kg−1 H2 in 2025, 10.56 $ kg−1 H2 in 2030 and 5.98 $ kg−1 H2 in 2035. Finally, the proposed design can provide policy-makers with the selection of sustainability pathways for dynamic hydrogen development planning. © 2023},

	abstract = {This article proposes a supply chain-based green hydrogen microgrid modelling for a number of remote Australian communities. Green hydrogen can be used as an emissions-free fuel source for electricity generation in places where large-scale renewable energy production is impossible due to land availability, population, or government regulations. This research focuses on the Torres Strait Island communities in northern Australia, where the transition from diesel to renewable electricity generation is difficult due to very limited land availability on most islands. Due to geographical constraints, low population and smaller electrical load, the green hydrogen needs to be sourced from somewhere else. This research presents a green hydrogen supply chain model that leverages the land availability of one island to produce hydrogen to supply other island communities. In addition, this research presents a model of producing and transporting green hydrogen while supplying cheaper electricity to the communities at focus. The study has used a transitional scenario planning approach and the HOMER simulation platform to find the least-cost solution. Based on the results, a levelised cost of energy range of AU$0.42 and AU$0.44 was found. With the help of a green hydrogen supply chain, CO2 emissions at the selected sites could be cut by 90 %. This study can be used as a guide for small clustered communities that could not support or justify large-scale renewable generation facilities but need more opportunities to install renewable generation. © 2023},

	abstract = {Low cost and environment friendly fly ash particles and silica particles were used as additives in the rigid polyurethane foam composite. The usage of fly ash will decrease the need for its handling and exposure to environment. FTIR spectra show the absence of hydrogen bonded urea which indicates no aggregation of hard urea domains in the soft polyurethane matrix after the addition of silica/fly ash. The composite loaded with 20 weight percentage fly ash had the highest glass transition temperature. At 10 weight percentage of the additive, the gross calorific value in the fly ash loaded composite decreased by 12% when compared with the composite loaded with silica. Introduction of fly ash into the foam composite up to a certain weight percentage (10 wt%) enhanced the compressive strength of the rigid polyurethane foam composite. The percolate particle concentration was at 10 weight percentage of the additive. The addition of fly ash increased the compressive strength up to 21% compared to the foam composite loaded with silica. Addition of fly ash in the foam composite resulted in a decrease of water absorption up to 23% in comparison to the composite loaded with silica. Hence, low cost and environment friendly fly ash is suitable additive which can be loaded into rigid polyurethane foams for superior enhancement in mechanical and thermal properties. Highlights: The addition of fly ash to the foam decreased the gross calorific value up to 12% compared to that of the silica loaded foam composite. The composite loaded with fly ash had highest normalized compressive strength and highest glass transition temperature than that of the unloaded foam. This can potentially replace conventional rigid polyurethane foam in timber constructions because of its higher compressive strength. We propose the addition of fly ash as a low cost, environment friendly additive as it improved the various properties of the polyurethane foam composite to a greater extent than silica particles. The greater usage of fly ash will help in the formation of a closed loop supply chain and alleviate the need for disposal of fly ash. © 2023 Society of Plastics Engineers.},

	abstract = {Local renewable ammonia production using electrolytic hydrogen is an emerging approach to alleviate emissions attributed to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer production while also insulating against fluctuations in fertilizer prices and mitigating transportation costs and emissions. However, replacing ammonia currently produced using fossil fuels will not be immediate. To this end, we develop a supply chain transition model, which first optimizes the design and hourly operation of new renewable ammonia facilities to minimize production costs and then optimizes the annual installation timing, production scale, and location of these new renewable facilities along with ammonia transportation to meet county resolution demands. The objective is to augment and eventually replace conventional ammonia market imports in an economically competitive manner. We performed a case study for Minnesota's ammonia supply chain and found that a full transition to in-state renewable production by 2032 is optimal. This is incentivized by the U.S. federal government's clean hydrogen production credits. This transition results in 99 % reduction in carbon intensity along with stable supply costs below $475 per metric tonne. New renewable production facilities are an order of magnitude smaller than existing conventional plants. They use both wind and solar resources and operate dynamically to minimize expensive battery and hydrogen storage capacities. © 2023 The Authors. ChemSusChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

Henceforth, this research aims at reducing plastic waste volume while simultaneously generating clean energy. Hydrogen energy is a promising fuel source that holds great value for humanity. However, achieving clean hydrogen energy poses challenges, including high costs and complex production processes, especially on a national scale. This research focuses on Iran as a country capable of producing this energy, examining the production process along with related challenges and the general supply chain. These challenges encompass selecting appropriate raw materials based on chosen technologies, factory capacities, storage methods, and transportation flow among different provinces of the country. To deal with these challenges, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to optimize the hydrogen supply chain and make optimal decisions about the mentioned problems. The supply chain model estimates an average cost—IRR 4 million (approximately USD 8)—per kilogram of hydrogen energy that is available in syngas during the initial period; however, subsequent periods may see costs decrease to IRR 1 million (approximately USD 2), factoring in return-on-investment rates. © 2023 by the authors.},

The current economic situation in Europe, including the global energy and economic crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, broken supply chains, and geopolitical conflicts, has led to a shift towards alternative fuels and AI-supported technologies. Hydrogen is identified as a key resource for this energy transformation, with potential applications as an energy source, energy carrier, and raw material. The article highlights the importance of green hydrogen produced through electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources. The use of AI is proposed to enhance the efficiency, control, monitoring, and prediction of hydrogen generation and storage technologies. The Polish energy sector, which heavily relies on coal, is analyzed, and the need for diversification through the integration of renewable energy sources and hydrogen technologies is emphasized. The article also discusses the challenges faced by prosumers (energy producers and consumers) in the context of intermittent energy production and grid limitations. Energy storage technologies, such as electrochemical batteries and hydrogen storage, are considered as solutions to overcome these challenges. The potential of hydrogen as an energy carrier and the role of AI in controlling and optimizing energy systems are highlighted.

This study addresses this imperative by simulating a green hydrogen supply chain tailored for residential cooking in Oman. The supply chain encompasses solar energy production, underground storage, pipeline transportation, and residential application, aiming to curtail greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The simulation results suggest leveraging a robust 7 GW solar plant. Oman achieves an impressive annual production of 9.78 TWh of green hydrogen, equivalent to 147,808 tonnes of H2, perfectly aligning with the ambitious goals of Oman Vision 2040. The overall LCOH for the green hydrogen supply chain is estimated at a highly competitive 6.826 USD/kg, demonstrating cost competitiveness when benchmarked against analogous studies. A sensitivity analysis highlights Oman’s potential for cost-effective investments in green hydrogen infrastructure, propelling the nation towards a sustainable energy future. This study not only addresses the pressing issue of reducing carbon emissions in the residential sector but also serves as a model for other regions pursuing sustainable energy transitions.

However, the region’s climate, population density and economic development set it at a disadvantage in generating cheap renewables. Although European governments have assumed that they will import resources like green-hydrogen derivatives to decarbonise industry in Europe, the region is likely to see several major industries relocate overseas instead. Although Europe will not experience wholesale deindustrialisation, the dislocations will still have a significant political impact. European governments will want to prop up their energy-intensive industries, but the strategic and economic rationale for doing so is weak. The region faces a tricky trilemma for energy-intensive industries, with trade-offs among industrial efficiency, industrial sustainability and industrial security–especially where governments assume that industrial security requires autonomy or local production. They can resolve the trilemma by shaping diverse global supply chains for energy-intensive goods and mitigating the impact of dislocations on local economies. © 2024 The International Institute for Strategic Studies.},

	abstract = {One of the important alternatives to conventional fossil fuel vehicles in the transportation sector is hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (HFCV) technology. One of the most significant obstacles to the widespread use of these vehicles is the hydrogen supply chain network (HSC) infrastructure. In the design of this network, the harm caused by the network to the environment and the security risks that may arise are as important as the associated cost of building it. In this study, an HSC design that will minimize cost, carbon emission and security risk for Turkey is proposed. The problem is modeled using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Five different optimization cases are studied when the penetration rate of HFCV is 25%. In the first three cases, the objectives are independently optimized. The multi-objective optimization is addressed in Case 4 and Case 5. Case 4 is solved with epsilon constraint method by employing the results of the first three cases. The most balanced solution found is 88%, 10% and 2% away from the best cost, carbon emission and risk values, respectively. It is observed that the proposed solution has a decentralized network structure where steam methane reforming (SMR) and electrolysis (ELE) production plants are established. In Case 5, the weighted sum method (another multi-objective optimization method) is used and those which gave the closest results to that of the epsilon constraint method are chosen as the associated weights of three objectives. Using these weights, 10 different demand scenarios are studied. It is observed that the HSC has a decentralized structure under almost all demand scenarios. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The increasing interest in electrolytic hydrogen production using renewable electricity sources will require to adapt power systems to new electrical loads for hydrogen production and supply chains. Such high loads would impact the long-term planning and operation of power systems, as they need to balance the variability of renewable generation sources with electricity demand. This stresses the importance of characterizing the impact of incorporating hydrogen supply chains into power systems and planning accordingly. This study proposes a methodological framework to assess the integration and development of a national power system with electrolytic hydrogen production and supply chain. The framework is based on the well-known optimization tool for energy systems planning, Open Source Energy Modeling System (OSeMOSYS). For a detailed representation, a module was developed where demand side technologies – such as those associated to hydrogen supply chains – can provide operating reserves. As a case study, the integration of the Chilean power system with a hydrogen supply chain for exporting hydrogen between 2018 and 2050 was modeled. Among other findings, results indicate that an on-grid hydrogen supply chain would be more cost-effective than an off-grid one. However, the new electrical loads originated from such hydrogen supply chain would require additional generation capacity — primarily photovoltaic. Other generation capacities such as concentrated solar power, wind, and storage would experience significant variations in their investment requirements, compared to the off-grid hydrogen supply chain scenario. The study revealed that the coordinated operation of electrolyzers is crucial to the operational flexibility of the new electrical system. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {An exclusively renewable energy economy is imperative for sustained industrial expansion. Despite notable progress, renewable energy sources fulfilled only 12.6% of global energy demand in 2022. This can be largely attributed to the suboptimal capacity utilisation of most renewable energy generators. Addressing this challenge, hydrogen and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) offer a distinct solution by leveraging economies of scale to substantially lower the levelised costs of delivery beyond current U.S. DOE targets. While several techno-economic assessments have examined specific hydrogen technologies, none have comprehensively evaluated numerous supply chain variations with consistent and comparable assumptions. Showcasing the Hydrogen Business Appraisal Tool (HBAT), we present a techno-economic analysis that evaluates technologies for the entire hydrogen supply chain, incorporating economic, environmental, and societal considerations for 64 unique variations. Notably, our study reveals efficient production capacities for each supply chain combination, suggests optimal reinvestment strategies, and quantifies the economic impact of continued investment in R&D for technology efficiency and longevity. Moreover, our analysis uncovers the environmental hazards associated with various hydrogen storage media, providing critical insights for sustainability decision-making. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the potential of renewable and low-carbon fuel production for the maritime shipping sector, using Sweden as a case in focus. Techno-economic modelling and socio-technical transition studies are combined to explore the conditions, opportunities and barriers to decarbonising the maritime shipping industry. A set of scenarios have been developed considering demand assumptions and potential instruments such as carbon price, energy tax, and blending mandate. The study finds that there are opportunities for decarbonising the maritime shipping industry by using renewable marine fuels such as advanced biofuels (e.g., biomethanol), electrofuels (e.g., e-methanol) and hydrogen. Sweden has tremendous resource potential for bio-based and hydrogen-based renewable liquid fuel production. In the evaluated system boundary, biomethanol presents the cheapest technology option while e-ammonia is the most expensive one. Green electricity plays an important role in the decarbonisation of the maritime sector. The results of the supply chain optimisation identify the location sites and technology in Sweden as well as the trade flows to bring the fuels to where the bunker facilities are potentially located. Biomethanol and hydrogen-based marine fuels are cost-effective at a carbon price beyond 100 €/tCO2 and 200 €/tCO2 respectively. Linking back to the socio-technical transition pathways, the study finds that some shipping companies are in the process of transitioning towards using renewable marine fuels, thereby enabling niche innovations to break through the carbon lock-in and eventually alter the socio-technical regime, while other shipping companies are more resistant. Overall, there is increasing pressure from (inter)national energy and climate policy-making to decarbonise the maritime shipping industry. © 2023},

	abstract = {This study investigates a two-stage production and replenishment problem for the hydrogen supply chain (HSC), where the uncertainty of demand and the risk of pipeline disruptions are simultaneously considered. We model this problem by adopting a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) approach. Before realizing the demands, the decision-maker decides the hydrogen production, storage, and truck-transported replenishment policies. Then, after demands and pipeline working status are realized, the pipeline-transported replenishment policy is determined in response to the first-stage decisions. The replenishment policies are determined under differentiated service level requirements. In addition, we characterize the uncertainty and correlation of demands through a factor-based model approach to accommodate the uncertainty of the distribution of demand factors. To solve the proposed model, we propose a column and constraint generation (CCG) algorithm, which can terminate in finite iterations. Through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we verify that the proposed model outperforms classical benchmark models in terms of total costs and are more robust. Finally, we examine the impact of the replenishment structure on the performance of the HSC and the computational efficiency of the proposed CCG algorithm. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The effective usage of renewable energy sources requires ways of storage and delivery to balance energy demand and availability divergences. Carbon-free chemical energy carriers are proposed solutions, converting clean electricity into stable media for storage, long-distance energy trade and on-demand electricity generation. Among them, hydrogen (H2) is noteworthy, being the subject of significant investment and research. Metal fuels, such as iron (Fe), represent another promising solution for a clean energy supply, but establishing an interconnected ecosystem still requires considerable research and development. This work proposes a model to assess the supply chain characteristics of hydrogen and iron as clean, carbon-free energy carriers and then examines case studies of possible trade routes between the potential energy exporters Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Australia and the energy importers Germany and Japan. The work comprises the assessment of economic (levelized cost of electricity - LCOE), energetic (thermodynamic efficiency) and environmental (CO2 emissions) aspects, which are quantified by the comprehensive model accounting for the most critical processes in the supply chain. The assessment is complemented by sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to identify the main cost drivers. Iron is shown to be lower-cost and more efficient to transport in longer routes and for long-term storage, but potentially more expensive and less efficient than H2 to produce and convert. Uncertainties related to the supply chain specifications and the sensitivity to the used variables indicate that the path to viable energy carriers fundamentally depends on efficient synthesis, conversion, storage, and transport. A break-even analysis demonstrated that clean energy carriers could be competitive with conventional energy carriers at low renewable energy prices, while carbon taxes might be needed to level the playing field. Thereby, green iron shows potential to become an important energy carrier for long-distance trade in a globalized clean energy market. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Over the last five decades, there have been several phases of interest in the so-called hydrogen economy, stemming from the need for either energy security enhancement or climate change mitigation. None of these phases has been successful in terms of a major market development, mainly due to the lack of cost competitiveness and partially due to technology readiness challenges. Nevertheless, a new phase has begun very recently, which despite holding original objectives has the new motivation to be fully green, i.e. based on renewable energy. This new movement has already initiated bipartisan cooperation of some energy importing countries and those with abundant renewable energy resources and supporting infrastructure. One key challenge in this context is the diversity of pathways for the (national and international) export of non-electricity renewable energy. This poses another challenge, that is the need for an agnostic tool for comparing various supply chain pathways fairly while considering various techno-economic factors such as renewable energy sources, hydrogen production and conversion technologies, transport, and destination markets, along with all associated uncertainties. This paper addresses the above challenge by introducing a probabilistic decision analysis cycle methodology for evaluating various renewable energy supply chain pathways based on the hydrogen vector. The decision support tool is generic and can accommodate any kind of renewable chemical and fuel supply chain option. As a case study, we have investigated eight supply chain options composed of two electrolysers (alkaline and membrane) and four carrier options (compressed hydrogen, liquefied hydrogen, methanol, and ammonia) for export from Australian ports to three destinations in Singapore, Japan, and Germany. The results clearly show the complexity of decision making induced by multiple factors, and that the preferred supply chain combination (electrolyser technology, green energy carrier) in terms of least cost strongly depends on whether the expected levelized cost of hydrogen (ELCOH) or the expected levelized cost of energy (ELCOE) is used as a decision criterion. For instance, with ELCOH for the case study, under the given input parameters, the Ammonia combination with alkaline electrolysers (AE-NH3) becomes the least-cost supply chain option for Singapore, Japan, and Germany with values of 8.60, 8.78 and 9.63 $/kgH2, respectively. This leaves liquid hydrogen (with alkaline electrolysers) as the second-best supply chain route, with ELCOH values of 9.05, 9.39 and 10.70 $/kgH2, respectively. However, with ELCOE, methanol (with alkaline electrolysers) becomes the preferred supply chain path for all destinations, and liquid hydrogen (with alkaline electrolysers) keeps its place as the second-best alternative. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, this work proposes an energy model to replace the Spanish vehicle fleet by hydrogen-fueled vehicles by 2050. Thus, six regions are defined according to their proximity to regasification plants, where hydrogen generation hubs are implemented. Likewise, renewables deployment is subject to their land availability. Hydrogen is transported through an overhauled primary natural gas transport network, while two distribution methods are compared for levelized cost of hydrogen minimization: gaseous pipeline vs liquid hydrogen supply in trucks. Hence, a capacity of 443.1 GW of renewables, 214 GW of electrolyzers and 3.45 TWh of hydrogen storage is required nationwide. Additionally, gaseous hydrogen distribution is on average 17% cheaper than liquid hydrogen delivery. Finally, all the regions present lower prices per km traveled than gasoline or diesel. © 2023 The Author(s)},

However, to achieve sustainable growth, the hydrogen generation process must be techno-economically feasible and have minimum carbon footprint. The techno-economic analysis (TEA) of various hydrogen generation process aids in identifying the effective bio-hydrogen generation process at minimal cost thereby aiding in faster dissemination of the system by attracting investors. Among the various techniques available for bio-hydrogen production, gasification was found to be most economical ($1.2/kg H2) followed by anaerobic digestion process ($1.25/kg H2). Meanwhile, after carrying out the life cycle analysis (LCA) of the different bio-hydrogen generation process, it was found that generation of bio-hydrogen by gasification of eucalyptus wood produced least carbon foot of −1.6 kg CO2eq./kg H2. Thus, the TEA and LCA of different biohydrogen production process also helps to identify the bottlenecks haunting the penetration of hydrogen in energy market which can be overcome by framing effective policies by the governing agencies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent decades, economic development and population growth has been accompanied by the generation of billions of tonnes of solid residues or municipal “wastes”, a substantial portion of which is composed of plastics and biomass materials. Combustion-based waste-to-energy is a viable and mature method of extracting calorific value from these end-of-life post-recyclable materials that are otherwise landfilled. However, alternative thermochemical methods, such as gasification, are becoming attractive due to the ability to synthesize chemical precursors for supply chain recirculation. Due to the infancy of gasification technology deployment, especially in the context of anthropogenic CO2 emission reduction, additional systems engineering studies are necessary. Herein, we conduct an attributional life cycle analysis to elucidate the syngas production and environmental impacts of advanced thermochemical gasification methods for the treatment of biomass and plastic wastes obtained from municipal solid wastes, using a comprehensive thermodynamic process model constructed in AspenTech. Feedstock composition, process parameters, and gasification methods are varied to study the effects on syngas quality, yield, power generation potential, and overall greenhouse gas emissions. Steam-based gasification presents up to 38% reductions in CO2 emissions when compared to conventional thermochemical methods. Using gasifier-active materials, such as metal hydroxides, can also further reduce CO2 emissions, and realizes a capture load of 1.75 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of plastic/stover feedstock. This design alteration has implications for reductions in CAPEX due to the mode of CO2 capture utilized (e.g., solid sorbent vs. liquid SELEXOL). The use of renewable energy to provide a method to generate steam for this process could make the environmental impact of such MSW gasification processes lower by between 60–75% tonnes of CO2 per tonne of H2. Overall, these results can be used to inform the guidance of advanced waste gasification methods as a low-carbon transition towards a circular economy. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A critical requirement of a widely contemplated hydrogen economy is the development of a low carbon hydrogen supply chain that is cost competitive. This comprehensive techno-economic assessment demonstrates, for the first time, the viability of a complete hydrogen supply chain based on the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This is demonstrated via the established LNG trade route from Australia to Japan against three key performance indicators (KPIs): delivered hydrogen cost, CO2 emissions intensity (EI) across the entire supply chain, and technology readiness level (TRL). The hydrogen supply chain entails LNG export to Japan where it is used for blue hydrogen production; the by-product CO2 is then liquefied and repatriated to Australia for sequestration or utilisation. Within this supply chain, various hydrogen production technologies are assessed, including steam methane reforming (SMR), autothermal reforming (ATR) and natural gas pyrolysis (NGP). SMR with carbon capture and storage (CCS) resulted in the lowest total hydrogen supply cost of 19 USD/GJ (2.3 USD/kgH2) which comfortably meets the 2030 Japanese hydrogen cost target of 25 USD/GJ (3 USD/kgH2) and is very close to the 17 USD/GJ 2050 Japanese hydrogen cost target. This technology also obtained the lowest CO2 emission intensity (EI) of 38 kgCO2/GJ (4.5 kgCO2/kgH2); this was surprisingly lower than ATR with CCS primarily due to the emissions associated with ATR electricity provision for air separation. Future technologies and strategies are detailed so as to further reduce cost and supply chain emissions; these were shown to be able to reduce total CO2 EI to 14 kgCO2/GJ (1.6 kgCO2/kgH2). Hence this analysis indicates that this supply chain can act to significantly reduce CO2 emissions whilst uniquely meeting targeted hydrogen supply costs up to 2050. As such it is proposed here as an eminently viable hydrogen export option deploying both existing technology and capacity, at least until other hydrogen supply chain vectors (such as liquid hydrogen and ammonia) derived from green hydrogen production become competitive across all the KPIs. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Polymers are extremely stable and with rising landfill costs, forthcoming extended producer responsibility tax and the drive towards a circular economy, there is an increasing need to redirect polymer waste from landfill/energy recovery towards enhanced recovery of the raw materials/feedstocks. The COVID pandemic has introduced a significant amount of personal protective equipment (PPE) single use plastics in the form of facemasks into our global ecosystem, which is increasingly becoming an environmental issue due to their increasing non-biodegradability and with declining landfill capacity, this makes plastic recycling a necessity. Chemical recycling stands out as a viable method of converting plastic waste into valuable products, especially liquid fuels (naphtha) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Chemical recycling of plastics can also serve as a route to introduce circularity into the plastic supply chain. This research study is focused on investigating the use of heterogeneous catalysts (zeolites Beta and USY) for the conversion of polypropylene (PP) and single use facemasks into chemical feedstock using hydrocracking. Catalytic hydrocracking reactions were carried out between 270-330°C at 20 bar hydrogen pressure for 30-60 minutes. The results indicates that USY zeolite was more effective than zeolite beta due to its higher selectivity to liquid products. Moreover, the presence of highly acidic catalysts can be used to suitably recycle polymers into useful hydrocarbons with C3-C16 product distributions. © 2023, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

	abstract = {It is a matter of great concern that the aviation industry, which has made significant contributions to the transportation sector, relies heavily on nonrenewable fossil fuels that are causing substantial pollution, leading to the industry's unsustainability. To address this issue, the industry has shifted its focus towards sustainable aviation fuels, with hydrogen fuel showing great promise due to its clean and eco-friendly nature. However, the adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier in aviation presents several challenges, including the lack of a supply chain comparable to that of kerosene, which is currently the primary fuel used in aviation. The supply chain for hydrogen involves various sub-sections such as production, liquefaction, transport, storage, and distribution. This study aims to analyze the hydrogen supply chains for airports and to develop scenarios for its implementation. The study evaluates the environmental impact, cost, sustainability, viability, and safety in different supply chain scenarios, as well as recommending a comprehensive approach to supply chain development that involves collaboration between industry, government, and academia. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Liquid hydrogen (LH2) is a promising hydrogen carrier because of its high density. However, liquefying hydrogen requires considerable energy and expenses. To enhance the sustainability, this study focuses on recovering cold energy from LH2 to mitigate costs and carbon emissions in LH2 supply chain. Three power generation configurations are proposed, combining the Brayton and Rankine cycles to efficiently recover cold energy across a wide temperature range of LH2. These configurations are the series Brayton and Rankine (SBR), the parallel Brayton and Rankine (PBR), and the integrated Brayton and Rankine (IBR) processes. In the SBR process, the Brayton cycle recovers cold energy from LH2 in the cryogenic temperature, followed by the Rankine cycle in the low temperature. The PBR process involves the Rankine cycle recovering LH2 cold energy indirectly from the Brayton cycle. In the IBR process, the Rankine cycle recovers cold energy not only from LH2 in the low temperature but also from the Brayton cycle. This results in the highest cold energy recovery performance and net power output, leading to a 6.19% reduction in carbon emissions within the LH2 supply chain. Furthermore, despite its high initial investment, the IBR process demonstrates economic feasibility due to its superior energy performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

A Pareto-curve was constructed to understand the trade-off between the Levelized cost of Hydrogen and emission reduction.

To address the resulting bi-objective optimization problem that aims to minimize both total daily costs and greenhouse gas emissions, a specialized solution strategy based on bi-level decomposition and a matheuristic algorithm is developed. This methodology for designing HSCs is applied to a case study in southern France, demonstrating the effectiveness of the solution technique in approximating the Pareto frontier.

Ammonia is a common commodity used in the fertiliser and chemical sector and has a potential to become an affordable and sustainable energy carrier to meet growing demand for industrial decarbonisation.

Potential options for hydrogen carrier are ammonia, liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LOHC), liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen, and methanol. This paper describes an innovative ceramics-based solid oxide fuel cell technology for conversion of ammonia into fossil fuel parity energy at a thermal efficiency of 85%. The technology is based on proton conducting ceramics (PCC) electrochemical pathway which eliminates NOx emissions by design and ammonia slippage by catalyst performance and reactor design. The technology has been developed over 7 years, between 2016 to 2022, and the ammonia utilisation capabilities has been proven through demonstrations conducted for O&G and industrial companies. The technology uses low-cost and widely available ceramics-based catalyst. The technology is particularly suited for industrial decarbonisation because of the ability to yield high efficiency and the ability to produce low-cost heat at 700C and hydrogen as byproducts. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

However, the high production cost of green H2 and technical complications of H2 storage conditions for distribution undermines the strategic framework of the H2 roadmap in Malaysia. The lack of investments in pre-requisite support infrastructure for the H2 production, conversion, and storage technologies impedes the progress of the H2 economy in Malaysia. Recently, ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a promising carbon-free energy carrier due to its increased ease and safety during transportation and storage. There is limited literature regarding the inclusion of an NH3 synthesis and storage loop in green H2 supply chains. This research proposes a systematic approach for the techno-economic evaluation of green H2 supply chains with green NH3 as a clean energy carrier of H2 storage and distribution. A superstructure-based mathematical optimisation model was developed to synthesise the optimum supply chain network configuration for a given optimisation objective.

	abstract = {Hydrogen-enriched compressed natural gas (HCNG) has great potential for renewable energy and hydrogen utilization. However, injecting hydrogen into the natural gas network will change original fluid dynamics and complicate compressed gas's physical properties, threatening operational safety of the electricity-HCNG-integrated energy system (E-HCNG-IES). To resolve such problem, this paper investigates effect of HCNG on gas network dynamics and presents an improved HCNG network model, which embodies the influence of blending hydrogen on the pressure drop equation and line pack equation. In addition, an optimal dispatch model for the E-HCNG-IES, considering the 'production-storage-blending-transportation-utilization' link of the HCNG supply chain, is also proposed. The dispatch model is converted into a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) problem using the second-order cone (SOC) relaxation and piecewise linearization techniques. An iterative algorithm is proposed based on the convex-concave procedure and bound-tightening method to obtain a tight solution. Finally, the proposed methodology is evaluated through two E-HCNG-IES numerical testbeds with different hydrogen volume fractions. Detailed operation analysis reveals that E-HCNG-IES can benefit from economic and environmental improvement with increased hydrogen volume fraction, despite declining energy delivery capacity and line pack flexibility.  © 2015 CSEE.},

	abstract = {As deviations in H2 production capacity by countries become a considerable barrier to the realization of the global H2 economy, international trade between countries with abundant resources and those with limited resources is required. In line with this trend, numerous supply chains between several countries have been planned, and associated studies have been conducted. However, the study which treats international overseas H2 trade chains considering numerous major importing and exporting countries has rarely been conducted before. In this study, a comprehensive optimization for the overseas H2 supply chain considering the three major importing countries including Korea, Japan, and Germany was conducted with mixed-integer linear programming considering both economic and environmental aspects simultaneously. Through the optimization study, the most feasible H2 supply chains for each importing country could be verified according to years and case scenarios. Blue H2 from Qatar turns out to be the most feasible supply chain for Japan in 2030, while green H2 from South Africa is the most feasible one for other importing countries. In 2040, green H2 from South Africa and Australia becomes the best one for Asian importers, and Australia finally dominates all the supplies after 2050. In the case of Germany, green H2 from Spain is considered the best after 2040. Depending on the scenario, the difference in the selected countries and supply amounts is not significant, though the costs are varied. Ammonia turns out to be the most feasible carrier for H2, and the total cost including the carbon tax ranges from 2.15 to 3.43 $ kgH2-1, which is a range from the current green H2 to the blue H2 price. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production through water electrolysis can play a role in the decarbonisation of energy systems when powered by electricity obtained from low carbon energy sources. The decision of deploying hydrogen technologies at a large scale in the future implies to get a comprehensive overview of the benefits and drawbacks on a variety of impacts compared to other alternative energy supply scenarios. The aim of this study was to perform a dynamic techno-economic and environmental impact assessment of renewable-based hydrogen supply chains relying on some of the characteristics of the GreenHysland EU deployment project in Mallorca (Spain). In this paper the optimization of the design and operation conditions of two hydrogen transport modes (trucks and pipeline) has been addressed for the supply of hydrogen to fuel cell buses and considering the possibility of injecting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. These hydrogen chains were assessed using PERSEE dynamic optimization tool developed at CEA relying on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming approach. A front of optimal solutions has been obtained considering both economic (Net Present Value) and environmental (cumulated equivalent carbon dioxide emissions) optimization criteria. Finally this study emphasizes the potential interest of such dynamic optimization approach to support impact assessment in pre-design phases of hydrogen projects complying with current and future greenhouse gases savings assessment methodologies defined at European level (e.g. RED II and related Delegated Acts) and corresponding green or low carbon hydrogen certification processes. This initial work opens the way to several perspectives for improvement in order to increase the robustness of these energy chain comparisons including sensitivity studies and the consideration of a broader set of environmental impact categories. These improvements are being reviewed by the research team and will help achieve a more complete analysis of the impacts of potential large-scale hydrogen deployment scenarios in the future energy mix of the Balearic Islands. © (2023) by ECOS 2023 All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a multi-echelon multi-objective network design model for urban-industrial symbiosis, combining biogas and hydrogen production plants with locally sourced organic waste as feedstock. The integrated biogas-hydrogen system utilizes locally sourced agricultural and organic waste as feedstock, enhancing rural processes sustainability and resource efficiency. The model optimizes the location of industrial plants based on environmental and economic parameters, including transportation emissions, energy consumption, and carbon footprint. A case study set in Emilia Romagna validates the model, and a sensitivity analysis examines the impact of varying input parameters on the designed industrial park. Results demonstrate that the novel combined biogas-hydrogen system not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also produces hydrogen at a lower cost due to the utilization of excess power from the biogas cogeneration plant. This research has significant implications, offering a sustainable and cost-effective hydrogen source while promoting efficient supply chain management and strategic decision-making in the renewable energy sector.

The system was designed to deliver electricity, heat, and H2 with a high energy efficiency, which can be realized through the integration of the exothermic phosphoric acid fuel cell and endothermic turboexpander generator modules. To extract additional useful work during the depressurization process in the natural gas supply chain, this multi-energy system is currently under construction on a pilot basis in South Korea. Based on a natural gas flow rate of 28,000kg/h, we analyze the performance of the system and its economic effects under different load demands and operating conditions. The system simulation results show that the total electrical power generated by the turboexpander generator and phosphoric acid fuel cell modules is approximately 3.395–3.539MWe, while the H2 yield is 19.94–40.00kg/h. In addition, an economic assessment of the multi-energy hub system is conducted based on the current natural gas, electricity, and H2 prices in South Korea. Assuming a life span of 20 years for the turboexpander generator and phosphoric acid fuel cell modules, the payback period is estimated to be between 7.09 and 10.05 years. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the untapped potential of the Permian Basin, a multifaceted energy axis in Texas and adjoining states, in the emerging era of decarbonization. Aligned with current policy directives on regional hydrogen hubs, this study explores the viability of developing a hydrogen energy hub in the Permian Basin, thereby producing low-carbon intensity hydrogen from natural gas in the Basin and transporting it to the Greater Houston area. Diverging from existing literature, this study provides an integrated techno-economic evaluation of the entire hydrogen value chain in the Permian Basin, encompassing production, storage, and transportation. Furthermore, it comparatively analyzes the scenario of interest against an optimized base scenario, thereby underlining comparative advantages and disadvantages. The paper concludes that the delivered cost of Permian-based low-carbon intensity hydrogen to the Greater Houston area is $1.85/kg, benchmarked to the scenario, with hydrogen produced close to the Greater Houston area and delivered at $1.42/kg. Our findings reveal that Permian-based low-carbon intensity hydrogen production can achieve cost savings in feedstock ($0.25/kg) and potentially accrue a higher production tax credit due to a shorter gas supply chain to production ($0.33/kg). Nevertheless, a significant cost barrier is the expense of long-haul pipeline transport ($0.90/kg) from the Permian Basin to Houston as opposed to local production. Despite the obstacles, the study identifies a potential breakeven solution where increasing the production scale to at least 412,000 metric ton per year (about 3 steam-reforming plants) in the Permian Basin can effectively lower costs in the transport sector. Hence a scaled-up production can mitigate the cost difference and establish the Permian Basin as a competitive player in the hydrogen market. In conclusion, a SWOT analysis presents Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats associated with Permian-based hydrogen production. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Increasing renewable power generation is a way to decarbonize power system. Hydrogen can be used as energy vector in a Power-to-Power (PtP) system to better manage the energy flow from renewables to users. Renewable Energy Community (so called REC) is proposed by RED II European directive to involve final users in energy management and to create conditions for local development of renewables. This work introduces a PtP hydrogen-based system, involving RECs to increase electric autarchy (self-sufficiency) of final users who have installed renewables in their electric market area (proximity of users). A double REC system is proposed in which the first REC generates renewable energy through a hybrid photovoltaic and wind system, and excess energy is stored as hydrogen generated through electrolysis; the second REC is powered by the hydrogen produced by the first one by means of fuel cell. Both RECs are connected to the power grid from which they can draw energy as well as put energy into it. Despite low round trip efficiency of a Power-to-Power hydrogen supply chain, the system increases users’ autarchy substantially (from 68.6% to 83.7%). Current costs of investigated apparatuses despite the public subsidies to REC makes the proposed system not sustainable from an economic point of view. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the transition to sustainable public transportation with zero-emission buses, hydrogen fuel cell electric buses have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional diesel buses. However, assessing their economic viability is crucial for widespread adoption. This study carries out a comprehensive examination, encompassing both sensitivity and probabilistic analyses, to assess the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the bus fleet and its corresponding infrastructure. It considers various hydrogen supply options, encompassing on-site electrolysis, on-site steam methane reforming, and off-site hydrogen procurement with both gaseous and liquid delivery methods. The analysis covers critical cost elements, encompassing bus acquisition costs, infrastructure capital expenses, and operational and maintenance costs for both buses and infrastructure. This paper conducted two distinct case studies: one involving a current small bus fleet of five buses and another focusing on a larger fleet set to launch in 2028. For the current small fleet, the off-site gray hydrogen purchase with a gaseous delivery option is the most cost-effective among hydrogen alternatives, but it still incurs a 26.97% higher TCO compared to diesel buses. However, in the case of the expanded 2028 fleet, the steam methane-reforming method without carbon capture emerges as the most likely option to attain the lowest TCO, with a high probability of 99.5%. Additionally, carbon emission costs were incorporated in response to the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability. The findings indicate that although diesel buses currently represent the most economical option in terms of TCO for the existing small fleet, steam methane reforming with carbon capture presents a 69.2% likelihood of being the most cost-effective solution, suggesting it is a strong candidate for cost efficiency for the expanded 2028 fleet. Notably, substantial investments are required to increase renewable energy integration in the power grid and to enhance electrolyzer efficiency. These improvements are essential to make the electrolyzer a more competitive alternative to steam methane reforming. Overall, the findings in this paper underscore the substantial impact of the hydrogen supply chain and carbon emission costs on the TCO of zero-emission buses. © 2023 by the authors.},

A techno-economic assessment of these hydrogen carriers is presented across a wide range of scales. Green formic acid is identified to be the most cost-effective carrier when the entire supply-chain cost is considered. Additional analysis shows that formic acid is the only green carrier that is more affordable to produce than its fossil-based counterpart and is the safest of the studied carriers.

	abstract = {Developing a global hydrogen economy that contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and achieves net-zero carbon emissions under the Paris Agreement requires evaluating and recognizing the economic, social, and political realities of green hydrogen production. This study performs a cradle-to-gate social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) of green hydrogen production via water electrolysis powered by renewable electricity from solar photovoltaic and wind farms in seven countries (the US, Chile, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Australia, and China) to identify the social hotspots in the entire value chain. The results of S-LCA indicate that green hydrogen production in South Africa poses the highest risk to most of the social indicators, especially child labor, fair salary, unemployment, association and bargaining rights, and gender wage gap. However, in the other countries, the risk to most of the social indicators drastically reduces when key equipment is manufactured in the country itself rather than when it is imported from other countries. Due to the increased complexity of the green hydrogen supply chain resulting from components sourced from various parts of the world, the S-LCA results indicate that compared with conventional hydrogen, green hydrogen performed poorly in various social indicators. The S-LCA results revealed that outsourcing key equipment from developing countries with poor working conditions is a major social hotspot in the sustainable development of these countries. In addition, the S-LCA results demonstrate that the hydrogen economy has the potential to be capable of achieving SDGS by developing a domestic green hydrogen supply chain and enhancing working conditions in country-specific sectors. Furthermore, a holistic discussion of socio-geopolitical implications is presented, emphasizing the need to develop standardized international regulations to prevent colonialism in the future hydrogen economy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Interest in low emissions hydrogen as an energy vector to assist in deep decarbonization goals has gained momentum recently. In this paper, we explore local hydrogen production from natural gas with CO2 capture and sequestration (known as “blue” H2) to support Singapore's intended inclusion of low-carbon intensity H2 fuel as a way to achieve significant CO2 emission reduction through 2050. A superstructure-based model is used to minimize the total cost or emissions of the entire supply chain, from H2 production to consumption in the power, industry, domestic, marine, and road transport sectors. H2 demand for each sector is projected for three H2 penetration scenarios (low, medium, and high). The results are analyzed for the levelized cost of H2, reduction in carbon emissions, and cost of carbon avoidance. Costs associated with direct and indirect CO2 emissions, as well as H2 and CO2 infrastructure costs, are included in total costs. A comparison of blue H2 and direct natural gas utilization with post-combustion CO2 capture and sequestration is also presented. We find that decarbonizing Singapore via local production of blue H2 will involve a relatively high carbon avoidance cost. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The study was organized in five steps. First, regarding the wind density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these locations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, it must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pump/compression stations required to transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia production in Iran, which is ready to be exported, considering all related processes involved in the hydrogen supply chain. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Renewable energy infrastructure struggles with location and long-distance transportation challenges. To address this, the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier has gained prominence. However, large-scale hydrogen transport poses difficulties. This study investigates converting hydrogen into more stable and transportable carriers, methanol and ammonia, with the aim of developing a sustainable green hydrogen supply chain. A versatile multi-period mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed for an optimal economic assessment. Using data from China, the model identifies key nodes, quantities of photovoltaic panels, and wind turbines required. The results favor wind power, accounting for 72 % of total installations. Despite renewable energy abundance in northwest China, long-distance transportation costs make other regions more economically viable. The total annual cost of creating a green hydrogen supply chain to meet demand from 35 large enterprises is estimated at approximately 9.96 billion USD, providing useful insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders. © 2023 Italian Association of Chemical Engineering - AIDIC.

	abstract = {Hydrogen production has become an emerging technology and offered a pathway to sustainable energy utilization in transportation systems. In this paper, we propose a coordinated planning of the electricity network and hydrogen refueling and production station planning strategy for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). In the proposed system structure, a hydrogen supply chain for FCEVs mainly composes hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs), hydrogen production stations (HPSs), hydrogen storage, and hydrogen delivery network. To enhance the system's flexibility, hydrogen delivery combines both gas pipeline delivery and truck logistics delivery. In the mathematical models, the synergistic effect and coupling relationship of the electricity network, gas network, and transportation network are presented. To ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the hydrogen refueling system, a quality of service (QoS) and reliability assessment method is presented. The proposed methodology is verified in case studies. It is found out that compared with the single delivery methods, the proposed multi-network coordinated planning has the lowest total cost with less unserved energy. Besides, through QoS and reliability assessment, enough hydrogen reserves can be maintained to cope with contingencies. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Various hydrogen pipeline structures for the export of hydrogen from Africa to Germany are analyzed by life cycle analysis (LCA) in order to determine the global warming potential (GWP) of the production and transportation of 1 kg of hydrogen. This analysis was motivated by the fact that a hydrogen pipeline infrastructure can be built cost-effectively by partially using existing natural gas pipelines. However, little is known about its possible environmental impact. In this paper, the LCA method is used to compare different import options, including possible changes to future supply chains. Three supply locations - Morocco, Senegal, and Nigeria - are compared with each other and evaluated using Germany's domestic hydrogen supply as a reference. Hydrogen transport via a pipeline from Morocco shows emissions of 0.07-0.11 kg CO2-eq per kg H2, and hydrogen transport from Nigeria causes emissions of 0.27-0.38 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. These figures are highly dependent on the flow rate of hydrogen, the GWP of PV electricity used to power the hydrogen compressors along the way, and compression efficiency. However, the GWP due to pipeline transport is negligible compared to the emissions caused by PV electrolysis. The total emissions of the African supply chain amount to 1.9-2.5 kg CO2-eq per kg H2. From a sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded that, by using identical PV panels, the GWP of German domestic hydrogen production (3.0-3.1 kg CO2-eq per kg H2) still has a higher GWP than hydrogen produced in Africa and imported through pipeline supply chains. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen plays a strategic role in the decarbonization of the maritime transportation. A step useful to favor the use and the exploitation of the hydrogen is the development of hydrogen supply chains that, by including both the infrastructures and the end users, can simplify the economic issues and the authorization processes. This paper is focused on the designing, sizing and economic feasibility of a sustainable supply chain that consists of a solar-driven electrolysis system that generates hydrogen for powering a fuel cell-based propulsion system installed on board a small passenger ferry boat travelling on a short route. The sizing procedure is based on a numerical procedure that aims to find the optimal supply chain configuration, in terms of components’ sizes, able to satisfy the hydrogen demand and to sustain the electrical energy requirements by only using the renewable source. Results of this study highlight that a hydrogen production of 128.7 tons/year is produced by using an alkaline electrolysis unit of 1780 kW integrated with a 8.15 MWp photovoltaic power plant. The produced hydrogen allows to satisfy the specific requirements of the ferry boat with a total number of 314 roundtrips per year. From the economic point of view, by valorizing the electricity surplus and the by-product oxygen from the electrolysis process, the estimated profitability index and the discounted payback period are 2.03 and 9 years, respectively, making the investment attractive. The calculated levelized cost of the produced green hydrogen is equal to 5.61 €/kg. These results demonstrate the techno-economic feasibility of the proposed supply chain based on hydrogen technologies that, being already available on the market, can be effectively implemented to support the decarbonization of the maritime sector. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

We employ a least-cost infrastructure planning framework to analyze the impacts of these uncertainties for future hydrogen supply chains. Falling electricity prices and electrolyzer capital expenditures would encourage investments in renewable hydrogen in all regions, more so outside California. Fossil-based hydrogen investments in California could continue well beyond 2030, but some of it could be disincentivized with additional renewable hydrogen mandates. Investments in building dedicated hydrogen pipelines require high degrees of demand certainty, which could be spurred by farsighted policy incentives. A complete reliance on an increasingly renewables-based electricity grid for hydrogen production can be expensive for California, unless grid-connected electrolyzers are further incentivized through favorable rate structures.

	abstract = {Sustainable Jet A-1 and radical technological changes are required to decrease the CO2 emissions of the aviation industry. While the CO2 reduction potential of electric aircraft is limited, the implementation of LH2 and LCH4 are exemplary radical technological changes with large potential impact. Recent studies have evaluated conceptual designs for planes utilizing LH2 and LCH4. Also, the costs of sustainable Jet A-1 and green hydrogen have been evaluated in different studies. However, most studies focus on one fuel and its production costs and do not include the production at a sweet spot and the subsequent logistic to the destination. To address this issue and present novel research results, we conducted a holistic techno-economic assessment for the different fuels that could be implemented in the aviation industry; LH2, LCH4 and sustainable Jet A-1. Based on renewable hydrogen produced in Morocco, we compared the aspects of a local fuel synthesis with the synthesis in Germany. CO2 is supplied from ambient air in Morocco and from a local point source in Germany. For the latter, we considered a hydrogen transport via LH2 or LOHC, with a direct integration of the LOHC dehydrogenation into the fuel synthesis plant. We outlined the cost composition of every fuel supply chain and retrieved LH2 import costs of 157 €/MWh while the cost range for LCH4 is 217–228 €/MWh. SAF has the highest net production costs of 279–302 €/MWh. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The need for a rapid transformation to low-carbon economies has rekindled hydrogen as a promising energy carrier. Yet, the full range of environmental consequences of large-scale hydrogen production remains unclear. Here, prospective life cycle analysis is used to compare different options to produce 500 Mt/yr of hydrogen, including scenarios that consider likely changes to future supply chains. The resulting environmental and human health impacts of such production levels are further put into context with the Planetary Boundaries framework, known human health burdens, the impacts of the world economy, and the externality-priced production costs that embody the environmental impact. The results indicate that climate change impacts of projected production levels are 3.3–5.4 times higher than the allocated planetary boundary, with only green hydrogen from wind energy staying below the boundary. Human health impacts and other environmental impacts are less severe in comparison but metal depletion and ecotoxicity impacts of green hydrogen deserve further attention. Priced-in environmental damages increase the cost most strongly for blue hydrogen (from ∼2 to ∼5 USD/kg hydrogen), while such true costs drop most strongly for green hydrogen from solar photovoltaic (from ∼7 to ∼3 USD/kg hydrogen) when applying prospective life cycle analysis. This perspective helps to evaluate potentially unintended consequences and contributes to the debate about blue and green hydrogen. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In Europe, green hydrogen and biogas/green gas are considered important renewable energy carriers, besides renewable electricity and heat. Still, incentives proceed slowly, and the feasibility of local green gas is questioned. A supply chain of decentralised green hydrogen production from locally generated electricity (PV or wind) and decentralised green gas production from locally collected biomass and biological power-to-methane technology was analysed and compared to a green hydrogen scenario. We developed a novel method for assessing local options. Meeting the heating demand of households was constrained by the current EU law (RED II) to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% relative to fossil (natural) gas. Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) analyses at 80% GHG emission savings indicate that locally produced green gas (LCOE = 24.0 €ct kWh−1) is more attractive for individual citizens than locally produced green hydrogen (LCOE = 43.5 €ct kWh−1). In case higher GHG emission savings are desired, both LCOEs go up. Data indicate an apparent mismatch between heat demand in winter and PV electricity generation in summer. Besides, at the current state of technology, local onshore wind turbines have less GHG emissions than PV panels. Wind turbines may therefore have advantages over PV fields despite the various concerns in society. Our study confirms that biomass availability in a dedicated region is a challenge. © 2023 The Authors},

PANI/CuO nanocomposites made by in situ (P-1) and bilayer (P-2) methods have shown high performances when sensing H2S of 0-25 ppm concentration in ambient conditions. The P-2 sensor maintained high sensitivity (S = 7.25) and excellent responsiveness (ΔRe = 188%). The P-1 sensor had high responses (<30 s), linearity (R2 = 99.5%), and stability, while the CuO NP sensor was especially sensitive (S = 13.5) within 0-10 ppm of H2S concentration. In addition, the flexible/conformable composite sensors had excellent H2S selectivity and bending stability. The enhancements of the composite sensors are mainly attributed to the PANI/CuO heterojunction formation that effectively reduced the PANI band gap from 2.51 eV (PANI) to 2.48 eV (P-1) and further down to 2.43 eV (P-2) for improved conductivity and charge-transport efficiency in the semiconductor network. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses identified elements and valence band energy changes before and after H2S exposure.

The results indicated that the Australia-East/Southeast Asia, West Africa-Europe, and Middle East-Europe routes have more competitive H2 shipping costs when compared to the Australia-Europe and Middle East-East Asia routes. Additionally, methanol has the lowest shipping cost among all H2 forms or media, followed by ammonia, DBT, MCH, and LH2. However, it is important to note that the higher cost of producing methanol may offset this advantage when considering the pricing of H2 for end users. © AGA 2023. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the economic and environmental implications of implementing green ammonia production plants in Spain. To this end, one business-as-usual scenario for gray ammonia production was compared with three green ammonia scenarios powered with different renewable energy sources (i.e., solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and a combination of solar PV and wind). The results illustrated that green ammonia scenarios reduced the environmental impacts in global warming, stratospheric ozone depletion, and fossil resource scarcity when compared with conventional gray ammonia scenario. Conversely, green ammonia implementation increased the environmental impacts in the categories of land use, mineral resource scarcity, freshwater eutrophication, and terrestrial acidification. The techno-economic analysis revealed that the conventional gray ammonia scenario featured lower costs than green ammonia scenarios when considering a moderate natural gas cost. However, green ammonia implementation became the most economically favorable option when the natural gas cost and carbon prices increased. Finally, the results showed that developing efficient ammonia-fueled systems is important to make green ammonia a relevant energy vector when considering the entire supply chain (production/transportation). Overall, the results of this research demonstrate that green ammonia could play an important role in future decarbonization scenarios. © 2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {As a secondary energy source, hydrogen produced by water electrolysis is a promising way to sustainably use electricity generated from primary renewable resources. Thereby, hydrogen is not only a highly relevant feedstock for producing chemical products, such as fertilizers and platform chemicals, but also a valuable energy carrier that can be readily transported and stored. This study explores how transporting renewable hydrogen via pipeline from regions with high renewable energy potential to large consumer centers can help overcome current challenges in ensuring a climate-friendly renewable energy supply. To this end, this work assesses the environmental impacts of cross-border hydrogen supply chains relative to the attained operating hours of local hydrogen production and the required hydrogen transport distance via pipeline. Environmental hotspots along the hydrogen supply chain and the main parameters affecting the overall environmental impact were identified. Remarkably, an environmental trade-off emerges: the most suitable local conditions for producing renewable hydrogen need to be balanced against the distance of hydrogen transport to consumers. Nonetheless, the relevance of the transport distance decreases with an increasing share of renewable energies in the electricity mix for operating the compressor stations of the pipeline network. Considering the ongoing transition towards renewable power generation technologies, our results indicate that long-distance hydrogen transport via pipeline is environmentally justified provided that the share of renewable energies used to operate the compressor stations increases. © 2023},

	abstract = {The transportation sector, which is largely dependent on oil, is faced with many problems such as the danger of depletion of fossil fuels that are harmful to the environment. Moreover, the situations such as epidemics and war cause excessive fluctuations in oil prices. Therefore, there is a need for new solutions based on alternative energy sources for a sustainable transportation sector. Hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (HFCEV) are one of the significant alternatives for an efficient, zero emissions and sustainable transportation system. Considering the potential investment in HFCEV technology, the need for a cost effective, green, and low risk Hydrogen Supply Chain (HSC) network infrastructure is inevitable. In this study, the HSC design of the Turkish transportation sector over a 25-year period (2026–2050) is investigated. The problem is modeled using a multi-period mixed integer linear programming (MIP) model. Three objectives are addresses: cost, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and safety risk. In order to consider the uncertainty in the hydrogen demand, five different scenarios are analyzed using fuzzy concept. There are four main results. First, unit hydrogen cost is found to be very high due to low demand and high capital cost in the initial period (2026–2031). Second, HSC network is established in a decentralized setting in all scenario solutions. The level of decentralization gets stronger over time and with increasing demand. Third, short-distance road transport is generally preferred for hydrogen transport. Fourth, since the aim is to minimize cost, CO2 emissions, and risk level, a mixed production strategy based on cost-oriented SMR and zero-emissions-oriented Electrolysis (ELE) is observed in all scenarios. © 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

Hydrogen emerged as a versatile energy carrier with immense potential, particularly in the realm of transportation. However, the lack of a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure poses a critical barrier to its widespread adoption. By examining various important factors including the pressure level, transported capacity, trailer capacity, pipeline diameter, pressure drop, and transport distance, this study aims to optimize the hydrogen supply chain and improve the cost-effectiveness of compressed hydrogen gas transportation. Five major delivery modes, encompassing compressed gas trucks and pipelines of varying diameters, are evaluated. This research offers valuable insights into the costs associated with hydrogen delivery within the European context. It reveals that the total levelized cost of hydrogen transportation (LCOHT) ranges from 0.3 to 3.44 € kg−1. These cost fluctuations are observed over transport distances that extend from 25 to 500 km and are dependent upon varying hydrogen demand levels, encompassing quantities of up to 100 000 kg per day. Based on the results, optimal choices for transport infrastructure are identified considering factors such as distance and hydrogen demand. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Liquified natural gas (LNG) is a major energy market experiencing significant supply chain evolution. Supply terms are progressively changing from long-term and binding contracts to shorter-term and flexible clauses, taking into consideration demand uncertainties. This context is making heavy investments in the LNG infrastructure risky, costly, and irreversible. The focus is shifting towards small-scale midstream facilities to develop small-size markets. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the LNG supply chain from an infrastructure investment approach based on market size and recent technological developments in the field. It addresses the limitations of the classic conducted supply chain and investigates best practices adapted to emerging markets. If properly executed, these logistics alternatives enable emerging markets to access LNG in a short period with lower investment. The objective is to maximize added value while minimizing cost and operational risks. This work suggests an alternative supply chain process replacing onshore terminals and pipeline delivery by Floating Storage Regasification Unit and truck delivery in the midstream market. A Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats analysis is conducted for the alternative supply chain model, showcasing the strengths and weaknesses alongside opportunities and threats.

	abstract = {The novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was extended to 213 countries globally by August 2021. The world has been threatened by rising infection rates and emerged as the catastrophic event in the field of health triggering the international emergency panic button. COVID-19′s sudden arrival wreaked havoc on the world economic picture, particularly in the energy sector. A steep drop in oil prices, as well as an imbalance in energy, was the result of strict travel restrictions, fewer transportation options, and people's fears of a flu pandemic. However, confined mobility and a drop in energy demand coated the environment with a silver line and drowned the nation's economic opportunities. Industrial transport, and not to mention every conventional energy-related thing, is completely devastated, but renewables were immunized. Wind, solar, hydrothermal, hydrogen, biomass-based energy systems were on high gear yielding maximum results in counterbalancing the demand–supply chain. Moreover, the pandemic created an opportunity to showcase the importance of renewable energy and tackle the difficult emergency like now. In addition to this, the mindset of the investors was slowly fading away from conventional fuels and shifting towards renewable energy. However, it is too early to state the booming renewables at the moment, and no idea about its long-time survival. Thus, the present review gives a clear picture of the current status of fossils and renewables, the impact of a pandemic, energy investments, government policy standings, threats, and opportunities, and finally, the key takeaways avoiding energy scarcity in once a lifetime disaster situation. © 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research},

	abstract = {The competition in the supply chain business has become considerably challenging. The environment protection is another problem adjacent to the competitive business. The supply chain players follow carbon policies to reduce carbon emissions along with profit maximization. But, asymmetric information sharing among supply chain players affects supply chain profit. This information asymmetry may be profitable for a few supply chain players but not beneficial for an entire supply chain and it may cause a non-coordination within them. A green supply chain management is developed with carbon tax & cap and trade regulations, where information asymmetry is reduced by the technology support through a radio frequency identification. This study finds the best service and distance between radio frequency identification readers to reduce asymmetry, and the optimum order quantity to obtain the maximum total profit for coordination or non-coordination policy. The objective function becomes a non-linear function with inequality constraint and the optimum solutions are derived using Kuhn–Tucker conditions. The optimum values of the objective function are found by using two subproblems because of the alternative scenarios of the cap and trade policy. Results indicate that a non-coordination policy is a better strategy than a coordination policy when information and product security play a major role in a green supply chain management. The effects of changes in cost parameters are identified via sensitivity analysis. The profit of the non-coordination policy is 6.07% more than the coordination profit. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Although hydrogen has been identified as key for a zero-carbon energy system, the design and deployment of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) is a challenging issue, in particular due to the various ways to produce, condition, store and transport hydrogen. Hydrogen demand is expected to increase rapidly as several new sectors (e.g. mobility, heat and buildings) in addition to the conventional industrial ones realize its applications. The paper addresses the emerging issue of how to design, organize and size the HSC. The problem involves a single optimization framework, where the total cost of the HSC is minimized, with a multi-period (2020-2040) mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that is implemented in the General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) environment, using CPLEX as a solver. The superstructure used for HSC modelling is split into six echelons, i.e., primary energy source, H2 production, conditioning and centralized storage, distribution, conditioning and decentralized storage, and finally usage. A case study for Italy has been developed, leading to a final hydrogen cost of 4.6€/kg in 2045. Various key performance indicators (KPIs) have been identified for the optimal solution obtained: centralization degree of the HSC, form of hydrogen (i.e. liquified, compressed), transport mode (gaseous or liquid H2 trucks, H2 pipeline) and economic parameters (i.e. investment, operation and maintenance costs). © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

However, hydrogen storage is currently a key challenge; one solution to this problem is hydrogen geo-storage, with which very large quantities of H2 can be stored economically. Possible target formations are deep coal seams, and coal permeability is a key parameter which determines how fast H2 can be injected and withdrawn again. However, it is well known that gas injection into coal can lead to coal swelling, which drastically reduces permeability. We thus injected H2 gas into a coal core and measured dynamic permeability, while imaging the core via x-ray micro-tomography at reservoir conditions. Importantly, no changes in coal cleat morphology or permeability were observed. We conclude that H2 geo-storage in deep coal seams is feasible from a fundamental petro-physical perspective; this work thus aids in the large-scale implementation of a hydrogen economy. © 2022.

	abstract = {This paper analyses the planning and operation of an energy district that aims to integrate a hydrogen supply chain for feeding vehicles based on fuel cell technology. A model of an energy district and an optimization algorithm based on the economic parameters are presented and validated leveraging an existing energy district, simulating several scenarios depending on different economic conditions and technical parameters. The model of the energy district evaluates energy balances, distinguishing hydrogen and electrical energy flows; the districts can include an FCEV fleet, electrical loads, energy generators, storage system and an electrolyser for producing hydrogen from the green energy surplus produced in the district as well as drawing energy from the power distribution network. The algorithm, based on MILP, is used for optimizing the flows in the district; indeed, it evaluates all the technical and economic constraints at a certain timestamp and provides optimal scheduling of the energy units. Model and algorithm have been used to evaluate different scenarios that were identified by varying the economic parameters (i.e., prices of electrical energy and hydrogen) as well as district design (i.e., upgrading sizes of the generators and electrolysers). Energy district parameters have been identified exploiting real data collected in an existing district located in Terni (Italy) owned by the local multi-utility ASM Terni S.p.A. It already includes a fleet for waste management, PV plants, office buildings and warehouses. Through parameters combination, 1125 OPEX and 729 CAPEX simulated scenarios have been evaluated and reported; each scenario assesses the daily variation of variables' economic trends covering the timeframe from 2030 to 2050. Results of simulations highlight the most convenient economic contexts as well as the envisioned amount of expenditures for adopting FCEV in the presented district or similar ones. For the case study, the forecasted cost of the hydrogen district, including FCEVs, is fully comparable to current costs, resulting in some cases even cheaper. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Abstract: This study develops a novel mathematical modelling framework for biomass combined heat and power systems (CHP) that links biomass and process characteristics to sustainability assessment of the life cycle. A total of twenty-nine indicators for the process (four-indicators), economic (five-indicators), environmental (eight-indicators) and social global (five-indicators) and local (seven-indicators) aspects have been analysed for sustainability. These are technological: biomass throughput, electricity and steam generations and CHP efficiency; economic: internal rate of return, capital, operating and feedstock costs and cost of production; environmental: global warming, fossil, land and water use, acidification, urban smog, eutrophication and ecotoxicity potentials; social (global): labour rights and decent work, health & safety, human rights, governance and community infrastructure; social (local): total forest land, direct/indirect jobs, gender equality and energy-water-sanitation access for communities, from biomass characteristics (carbon and hydrogen contents), energy demands and economic parameters. This paper applies the developed methodology to a case study in Mexico. From 12.47 kt/year forestry residue, 1 MWe is generated with an associated low-pressure steam generation of 50 kt/year, at the cost of production of $0.023/kWh. This makes the energy provision “affordable and clean” for marginalised/poor communities (the UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDG7). Bioenergy can curb > 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy use, 6 kt CO2 eq and 74 TJ annually. Bioenergy reduces other environmental impacts considerably, water consumption, acidification and eutrophication by 87–53%, and urban smog and ecotoxicity by 29–18%. Bioenergy can improve all five social themes in the Central American cluster countries. In addition to the SDG7, the forestry-based bioenergy system can also achieve the SDG6: "clean water and sanitation for all".

The problem is motivated by the real-world problem of locating facilities for green hydrogen in Norway. We formulate a model with modular capacities. Investment in a facility and expansion costs represents long-term costs. For each capacity, we define a convex short-term production cost function which enables to capture economies of scale in investment as well as in production. The objective is to minimize the total expected investment, expansion, production and distribution costs while satisfying demand in each scenario. We solve the problem using sample average approximation.

	abstract = {Nuclear hydrogen production via commercially mature water electrolysis technology is a promising, low-carbon route to bulk quantities of hydrogen for industrial decarbonization. This has special relevance to all energy resource-poor countries like India who must also reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels and chemical feed stock like natural gas. This study assesses green hydrogen demand in major Indian industries vis-à-vis the corresponding hydrogen supply capability via water electrolysis by Indian nuclear power reactors. India's existing, upcoming, and planned nuclear reactors can power modular water electrolysers to produce 1.8–4.0 million metric tons H2 per annum at annualized production costs competitive with current renewable hydrogen costs. Nuclear hydrogen can meet between 6% and 15% of the current green hydrogen demand of priority sectors in India. Project profitability requires sale price of nuclear hydrogen to be at least 60% to 90% above the levelized production cost. Depending on the end user sectors, nuclear hydrogen can enable avoidance of 490–570 million tons CO2 per annum from several industries beyond the electric power sector. Novelty Statement: The study analyses the potential of India's existing and upcoming nuclear power reactors to diversify and support the creation of a domestic green hydrogen supply chain for decarbonization of critical and hard-to-abate industries. It analyzes sectoral demands for hydrogen, techno-economic aspects of nuclear hydrogen production using site-specific data, including comparison with solar hydrogen. It emphasizes the importance of diversifying the energy mix used for large quantities of green hydrogen for sustainable decarbonization of sectors like fertilizers, metallurgy, and long-distance transport. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {As the prospect of the fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) market is uncertain, the effects of government subsidies on the commercial diffusion of hydrogen production infrastructure will need to be effectively evaluated to help policymakers decide how they should financially support the development of future hydrogen technologies. Currently, there is a high intermediate cost in the supply chain of centralized hydrogen production. Decentralized on-site hydrogen production technology is an effective alternative method that can guarantee the operation of hydrogen refueling stations and has been attracting more and more attention from the public. In this paper, which is based on market data from California, we build a system dynamics model to simulate the feedback mechanism of the effects of public funding on the commercial diffusion of on-site hydrogen production technology. The insights derived from the simulation of our system dynamics model suggest that: (1) moderate public funding can help establish the scale of application of on-site hydrogen production technology in the early stages of market development and also provide buffer time for technology upgrading; (2) the adoption of large on-site hydrogen refueling stations is a feasible approach to shorten the standstill period; and (3) excess levels and periods of subsidies would stagnate the growth of supply and demand. We conclude with a discussion about the relevant policy implications from these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

Argonne National laboratory developed cost and energy/emissions estimates of various options for fueling hydrogen fuel cell HDV fleets, considering various hydrogen supply chain (e.g., gaseous vs. liquid). In general, liquid hydrogen sourcing provides a significant cost advantage for large fleets with high fueling rates, compared to gaseous hydrogen supply to fueling stations. However, the hydrogen liquefaction is an energy intensive process that affects life-cycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, depending on the electricity generation mix used for liquefaction. The contribution of refueling station to total hydrogen cost at dispenser is between $2-5/kgH2, depending on daily and hourly fueling demand and speed, but can be reduced to $1/kgH2 when considering large fleets and high production volume of fueling components. The fueling station cost contribution can be further reduced to <$1/kgH2 by considering low-pressure liquid hydrogen storage onboard the fuel cell M/HDVs. © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to evaluate the costs and GHG emissions of advanced biofuels production through hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of sewage sludge in The Netherlands targeting the marine fuels market. The process evaluated consists of a distributed configuration of regional HTL plants co-located with wastewater treatment plants, with centralized hydrotreating co-located with an existing refinery at the Port of Rotterdam. The process is simulated in ASPEN + based on published experimental data and the mass and energy balances are used as input for techno-economic and environmental evaluation. Lifecycle GHG emissions of the HTL and hydrotreating processes are estimated using consequential modelling principles and background data from the Ecoinvent database and compared with the business-as-usual scenario of sludge mono-incineration and fossil marine fuels production. The results indicate that the HTL + hydrotreating configuration has potential to deliver on-spec marine biofuels at a minimum fuel selling price between 410 and 1300 EUR/t, being at least 3 times more beneficial compared to the business-as-usual scenario from a GHG emissions perspective. Future work is recommended to optimize the size and location of the HTL plants in order to decrease capital costs and to address uncertainties regarding the sludge gate fee and the costs associated with the aqueous and solid by-products treatment. The results indicate the potential of such configuration in locations with relatively high population density and good transport infrastructure. This can be the case of port areas around the North Sea with access to offshore renewable electricity for hydrogen production, where drop-in marine biofuels are expected to play a role with the increasing share of renewables in the marine fuels mix. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Freight trucks powered by alternative low-emissions fuel sources such as electricity or hydrogen have gained significant attention as replacements for their fossil fuel-operated counterparts. Even though this shift to alternative fuels can reduce the operational emissions at the vehicle tailpipe, there can be significant emissions throughout their supply chains. A thorough review of the published literature highlights that a comprehensive investigation is lacking on the well-to-wheel life cycle impacts of hydrogen fuel used for freight transportation. Furthermore, a comparison between hydrogen-fueled and electric freight transport is unavailable in the published literature. This study comprehensively investigated the life cycle environmental and economic impacts of alternative fueled freight transport based on vehicle types and relevant supply chains. A life cycle impact database was developed for key electric and hydrogen fuel supply chain scenarios and was ranked based on the economic and environmental performance under different decision-maker perspectives. The life cycle emissions of delivering hydrogen fuel range from 2.2 to 12.6 kgCO2eq./kg of hydrogen whereas electric grid emissions range from 0.005 to 0.315 kgCO2eq./MJ. However, hydrogen systems that use electrolysis to produce hydrogen show better environmental performance over the complete vehicle life cycle compared to electric systems that are highly dependent on nonrenewable energy sources. The cost of ownership of a hydrogen and electric freight truck is approximately 2.15 and 0.54 CAD/km respectively. However, with investments from governments and private institutions to develop hydrogen refueling infrastructure, hydrogen-fueled freight vehicles have the potential for reducing GHG emissions in the road transportation sector. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Haber-Bosch (HB) process, the main method for ammonia (NH3) production, contributes to near 2% of the global carbon emissions because the hydrogen input is obtained from fossil sources. NH3 production is concentrated in a few countries, adding emissions due to global distribution. Distributed plants next to farmers and fed by renewable energy can reduce these impacts, as well as NH3 storage, shortage risks, and price volatility. Distributed plants cannot reach low NH3 production costs as centralised plants, but they can be promoted by the environmental benefits of its products lifecycles. Therefore, life cycle assessments of NH3 production pathways and specific modelling for NH3 transport in Australia were performed, from cradle-to-site, to identify the influence of storage, transport, and energy sources in their environmental profiles. The carbon footprint of centralised production was up to 2.96 kg.CO2-eq/kg.NH3, from which 29.3% corresponded to transport. Local production demonstrated substantial avoided transport impacts and that CO2-eq can reach reductions over 100% when including co-product credits such as oxygen and carbon black. Local plants using electrolysers to supply mini-HB loops obtained rates of 0.12, −0.52, and −1.57 kg.CO2-eq/kg.NH3 using electricity from solar, wind, and biogas (other than manure) sources, respectively. The alternative using high temperature plasma reactor instead of electrolyser obtained its best rate of −0.65 kg.CO2-eq/kg using biogas different from manure. At farm electrolyser-based plants using novel non-thermal plasma reactors, considering potential energy yields and simplified NH3 separation technology, could reach a rate of −1.07 kg.CO2-eq/kg.NH3, using solar energy. Among the assessed pathways, the most notable impact was on freshwater eutrophication in the electrolyser-based plants generating reductions up to 290%, due to oxygen credits. Despite these results, the use of solar energy raises concerns on land use and terrestrial ecotoxicity due to the area needed for solar farms and the manufacture of their components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

For this purpose, we simulate a techno-economic hydrogen supply chain based on generation from renewable energy sources. The chain of production, conversion, and transportation costs, in combination with potentials, yields a merit order of hydrogen supply. The paper focuses on one low-cost option for imports from the middle east and north Africa region. In addition, it provides a classification of additional options. We find that due to proximity, retrofitting and potentially even installing new pipelines from Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia could provide nearly half the expected European demand of 60 million tons p.a. by 2050.

Offshore wind power generation is attracting attention due to its superior wind conditions at sea compared to those on land, ease of scaling up, and low impact on people, such as noise. In this study, a 722 MW offshore wind power generation system is planned off the coast of Hiyama in southern Hokkaido to supply energy to the city of Hakodate. The proposed system will transmit the output power to a substation near Hakodate City via a transmission line. The transmitted power will be used to supply power according to the power load via the transmission line. The surplus power is used to generate and store electrolytic hydrogen. The stored hydrogen is used to stabilize the power supply using fuel cells when the power supply is insufficient. Considering the efficiency of each device, excess electricity was converted to hydrogen for storage and used to adjust the electricity supply, resulting in a supply that is more than 70% of the demand. Comparing the installation costs of hydrogen storage and storage batteries, storage is cheaper than storage batteries when the hydrogen tank capacity is 140,000 kg or more.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The relevance of Fuel Cells and Hydrogen (FCH) systems as decarbonisation solutions has grown significantly during the past decade. However, a sustainable life-cycle performance of FCH systems should be guaranteed. In this sense, while the focus is typically placed on their economic and environmental performance, scarce attention is usually paid to the social dimension, which should be assessed to avoid burden shifting. In this work, a Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) of a 5 kW Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) stack was carried out within the context of the eGHOST project. The system boundaries include the extraction of materials, the manufacturing of components and the final assembly of the stack parts (balance of plant excluded). Design parameters such as current density, degradation and lifetime were defined considering 2030 targets, when this type of electrolysers is expected to be commercially mature. Inventory data (including working hours) were adapted accordingly from literature sources, while trade information from the UN Comtrade database was used for the regionalisation of the supply chain. Modelling and evaluation were performed using openLCA and the PSILCA database and method. Overall, stainless steel production in Spain arose as the main social hotspot under most of the evaluated indicators. © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

The experiences are matched with open challenges identified for hydrogen certification. The evaluation shows that a number of lessons learnt from biofuel certification can be applied to hydrogen. These include among others the need for unambiguous definitions of the certified renewable fuel, consideration of indirect environmental and social impacts as well as transparent monitoring of conflict of interests in the certification process.

	abstract = {Hydrogen systems are gaining importance in view of a progressive decarbonisation of societies, and becoming more and more cost-competitive alternatives in many sectors (e.g., mobility). However, the sustainability of these technologies must be carefully assessed following a holistic approach which embraces not only environmental but also social aspects. Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) is an insightful methodology to evaluate potential social impacts of products along their life cycle. In the frame of the project eGHOST, social risks of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack were assessed through an S-LCA. The functional unit was defined as one 48 kW stack (balance of plant excluded), targeted for mobility applications. The supply chain was defined assuming Spain as the manufacturing country and involving from the material/energy production plants to the stack manufacturing. Beyond conventional life cycle inventory data, trade information and additional inventory data were retrieved from the UN Comtrade and PSILCA databases, respectively. Besides, working hours for the manufacturing plants of the stack and its subcomponents were calculated based on literature data. Social life cycle inventories were modelled and evaluated using openLCA and the PSILCA method. Two stakeholder categories, workers and society, were considered through the following social indicators: child labour, contribution to economic development, fair salary, forced labour, gender wage gap, and health expenditure. The choice of these indicators is in line with the eGHOST project purpose. Despite the relatively small amount contained in the product, platinum clearly arose as the main social hotspot under each of the selected indicators. At the level of component plants, the manufacturing of bipolar and end plates was also found to be relevant under some indicators. On the other hand, electricity consumption generally accounted for a minor contribution. Overall, in order to avoid burden shifting from environmental to social issues, a careful design of technologies is needed. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

Such large-scale curtailed electricity could be used to produce hydrogen via power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology. The introduction of P2H would largely affect the configuration of both the power grid and hydrogen supply chain (HSC). This article proposes a coordinated planning model of power system generation and transmission (GT) as well as HSC with transportable seasonal hydrogen storage. A coplanning model is put forward to investigate the optimal configuration of infrastructures in the GT-HSC and their coupling during operation. The model is formulated as an LP model so that the year-round energy balance of seasonal hydrogen storage with daily resolution could be considered. Case studies on 5-bus PJM system and Northwest China HRP-38 system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results of the case study also illustrate the benefits of incorporating GT with HSC to reduce the renewable energy curtailment and bring down the energy supply cost.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Decentralised renewable energy production in the form of fuels or electricity can have large scale deployment in future energy systems, but the feasibility needs to be assessed. The novelty of this paper is in the design and implementation of a mixed integer linear programming optimisation model to minimise the net present cost of decentralised hydrogen production for different energy demands on neighbourhood urban scale, while simultaneously adhering to European Union targets on greenhouse gas emission reductions. The energy system configurations optimised were assumed to possibly consist of a variable number or size of wind turbines, solar photovoltaics, grey grid electricity usage, battery storage, electrolyser, and hydrogen storage. The demands served are hydrogen for heating and mobility, and electricity for the households. A hydrogen residential heating project currently being developed in Hoogeveen, The Netherlands, served as a case study. Six scenarios were compared, each taking one or multiple energy demand services into question. For each scenario the levelised cost of hydrogen was calculated. The lowest levelised cost of hydrogen was found for the combined heating and mobility scenario: 8.36 € kg−1 for heating and 9.83 € kg−1 for mobility. The results support potential cost reductions of combined demand patterns of different energy services. A sensitivity analysis showed a strong influence of electrolyser efficiency, wind turbine parameters, and emission reduction factor on levelised cost. Wind energy was strongly preferred because of the lower cost and the low greenhouse gas emissions, compared to solar photovoltaics and grid electricity. Increasing electrolyser efficiency and greenhouse gas emission reduction of the used technologies deserve further research. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Energy transition (ET) is growing fast with governments and companies around the world stepping up their efforts toward decarbonization to limit greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) with the ultimate aim of carbon-neutral (net-zero) production. The carbon footprint (CFP) of industrial production, especially in the resources industry is an essential part of the environmental, social, governance (ESG) criteria which are part of the fight against climate change. The CFP is measured in t CO2e(CO2equivalent) and strongly correlated to the energy intensity in MWh/t of produced mineral. The CFP is strongly dependent on locations and infrastructure where the specific energy supply structure is mainly determining the magnitude of emissions. The ET is demanding huge amounts of steel, metals and other critical minerals from fresh production or from recycled materials. The resources industry is confronted with three Scopes of GHG-Emissions. Scope 1 emissions are the directly released CO2emissions especially from diesel fuels used in mining operations, but also the methane gas emissions from coal deposits during mining. Scope 2 covers the indirect emissions from purchased energy, such as electric power but also inherently contained emissions in consumables and machinery. Scope 3 are the emissions in the downstream chain, released from the customers using the mined and processed minerals. They include ocean transportation of bulk material and all corporate overhead activities. While the scope 1 & 2 emissions account for 4 to 7 % of global GHG releases, this number increases to almost 30 % when the huge amount scope 3 is included. The best way to reduce the CFP is the use of regenerative energies, such as hydropower, solar- and wind energy. The article clarifies the CFP of the steel and iron-ore and cement industry and of the minerals and metals for the electric vehicles (EVs) such as aluminium, cobalt, copper, graphite, lithium, manganese, nickel and rare earths. The CFP of recycling within a circular economy is treated as well as the plans in the mining industry to reduce the CFP. Technical solutions to reduce the CFP in opencut and underground mining operations are presented. The most effective is electrification of mining equipment based on regenerative energies by use of trolley assisted trucks, batteries and hydrogen fuel-cells. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and the special CO2-sequestration in waste rock or mine tailings is explained. The related subjects tracing of GHG emissions including greenwashing in the supply chains are pointed out. Finally, regulatory actions of governments and corporate initiatives to control ESG compliance with regards to emission control are shown. © 2022 GDMB Gesellschaft fur Bergbau, Metallurgie, Rohstoff- und Umwelttechnik e.V..

	abstract = {The global steel industry is entering a period of change unprecedented in its long history, and Australia, with the globally largest exports of both iron ore and metallurgical coal, must consider its position carefully. Steel production is critical to the support of global economic development and employs sophisticated, mature and highly-optimised blast furnace technology, but is nevertheless responsible for 7–9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Global net-zero pledges mean that the industry cannot proceed with only incremental improvements, and must anticipate major changes to its core processes, or else depend on negative emissions technologies that may cost even more to implement. Transition scenarios in this paper highlight the rate at which ‘green steel’ technologies would need to be deployed to meet sectoral net-zero targets. The paper shows the co-location of Australia's major iron ore deposits with excellent renewable energy resources, highlighting a potential advantage for local large-scale development of this industry. Deploying the huge renewable energy infrastructure required would lead to potential challenges for global materials supply chains. For Australia to find a strong and ongoing role in this industry, there it will need to consider long-sighted environmental and industrial policies, including R&D funding, project financing and (low-)emissions certification. © 2022},

	abstract = {Global carbon emissions from electricity and hydrogen production have grown rapidly in recent years. Some existing literature has proposed the method of reducing carbon emissions by power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology. However, due to the fossil-based energy structure of electricity system, excessive electricity to hydrogen may lead to an increase in carbon emissions. To reduce carbon emissions effectively, a low carbon-driven optimal capacity configuration method for P2Hs is proposed in this paper to explore carbon equilibrium in integrated electricity-hydrogen system. A joint economic dispatch model for integrated electricity-hydrogen system is formulated. The electricity system model is a security-constrained economic dispatch model with P2H constraints. The hydrogen system model is a hydrogen supply chain model with pipeline pack constraints and Weymouth equation, whose sources are fossil fuel reforming and electrolytic hydrogen. We propose a second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based solution to transform the hydrogen system model into a mixed integer second order cone programming (MISCOP), which can be readily solved by commercial solvers. To preserve the internal information of each system, a decentralized algorithm based on optimality condition decomposition (OCD) is developed. Case study based on modified IEEE 30-bus and Belgium 20-node integrated energy system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. IEEE},

The model includes hydrogen grades and separation/purification technologies, offering the possibility to assess the effects that hydrogen grades play in the development of cost-effective hydrogen supply chains, including the decisions to repurpose gas distribution networks or blending hydrogen into them. The model is implemented in a case study of Great Britain, for a set of decarbonisation and learning rate scenarios. A base case with a medium carbon price scenario shows that the total discounted cost of the hydrogen supply chain is significantly higher than shown in previous studies, largely due to the additional costs from purification/separation needed to meet hydrogen purity standards for transport applications. Furthermore, it was shown that producing hydrogen from steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage; installing new transmission pipelines; repurposing the gas distribution network to supply 100% hydrogen; and purifying hydrogen with a pressure swing adsorption system locally at the refuelling station; is a cost optimal configuration for the given technoeconomic assumptions, providing hydrogen at £6.18 per kg at the pump. Purification technologies were found to contribute to 14% and 30% of total discounted investment and operation costs respectively, highlighting the importance of explicitly including them into hydrogen supply chain models for the transport sector. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen compression is a key part of the green hydrogen supply chain, but mechanical compressors are prone to failure and add system complexity and cost. High-pressure water electrolysis can alleviate this problem through electrochemical compression of the gas internally in the electrolyzer and thereby eliminating the need for an external hydrogen compressor. In this work, a detailed techno-economic assessment of high-pressure proton exchange membrane-based water electrolysis (PEMEL) systems was carried out. Electrolyzers operating at 80, 200, 350, and 700 bar were compared to state-of-the-art systems operating at 30 bar in combination with a mechanical compressor. The results show that it is possible to achieve economically viable solutions with high-pressure PEMEL-systems operating up to 200 bar. These pressure levels fit well with the requirements in existing and future industrial applications, such as e-fuel production (30–120 bar), injection of hydrogen into natural gas grids (70 bar), hydrogen gas storage (≥200 bar), and ammonia production (200–300 bar). A sensitivity analysis also showed that if the cost of electricity is sufficiently low (<0.1 € kWh−1), it may even be economical to operate PEMEL systems with hydrogen outlet pressures up to 350 bar. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Energy producers are under tremendous pressure to abate GHG emissions earlier than previously thought. The call for action is driven by multiple factors such as climate activism, policy regulations, a global pandemic and geopolitical conflict. Hydrogen is widely considered the most important energy carrier in a decarbonized future. As organizations are revisiting their business models to evaluate the impact of a shift from fossil fuels to Hydrogen, terms such as "Energy Transition", "Carbon Management" and "Hydrogen Economy" are now making frequent appearances in business and project management plans. The global pandemic and cataclysmic geopolitical conflicts may have expedited this shift in strategies, and to some extent exacerbated capital risks faced by mega projects. As a result, a fundamental realignment in Project Management strategies seem inevitable. While managing the Energy Transition, the traditional Oil & Gas PM knowledge areas will require a "reframing" of sorts. This paper investigates the Project Management challenges and opportunities in a large, Joint Venture capital project in the Energy Transition context. The Paris Agreement, the international treaty on climate change, has intensified the discussions around low carbon energy sources. The transition to Hydrogen is sometimes envisaged to happen with cross-sectoral coupling (CO2 capture, Renewable Energy storage). Its long-term implications in terms of project complexity management, technological maturity and economic feasibility along with stakeholder influences will be reviewed. The high-level interface aspects from technology integration viewpoints and Project Human Resource Management challenges will also be addressed. Other important present-day change drivers include impacts of Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflict in Europe, which have led to watershed policy changes such as Joint European action for secure energy (REPowerEU). Rejigging Risk Management, Contract Management, Supply Chain and Stakeholder alignment strategies in the post pandemic world are key execution strategy elements for Hydrogen projects and these will be reviewed on the basis of learnings from Oil & Gas Project execution management. The fundamental changes in Gas and Oil based Capital Project Management and learnings to be harvested for Hydrogen projects will be elaborated utilizing identified critical change drivers. Project Configuration, Integration and Risk management perspectives will be analyzed from Owners' viewpoints. Additional Critical Success Factors, Project Definition Parameters or integrated Front End Loading (iFEL), Project assurance and leadership model will be identified and elaborated. An overall execution strategy focused on new project realities beyond the realm of triple project constraints will be outlined. The strategic redefinition of Project Management functions in the context of Energy Transition and their deployment will be administered via a competent Project Management Office (PMO) function. Authors identify the PMO's leading role in Change Management, harvesting learnings and synergies, stakeholder alignment and overall strategy definition.

	abstract = {The cost of hydrogen at a refueling station depends mostly on two factors, the hydrogen production itself and the hydrogen supply chain. For both there are different options with LOHC that are in the focus of several scientific discussions. The aim of this work is to contribute to this discussion a techno-economic comparison of a 350 bar Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC)-supplied hydrogen refueling station (HRS) with a standard HRS. The analysis was focused on supplying hydrogen for a fleet of busses or trains with a total daily hydrogen demand of around 1.2 t/d. A dehydrator required to release the hydrogen from the LOHC as well as other standard components of an HRS were dynamically modelled and optimised depending on various demand profiles of the vehicle fleets using the inhouse simulation software H2ProSim. The results show specific refueling costs (HRS only) of between 2.1 €/kg and 3.3 €/kg for the LOHC-HRS scenarios investigated and a minimum of 0.89 €/kg can be obtained for a standard HRS. This cost difference is mainly caused by the high energy cost of the dehydrator and the added CAPEX. Furthermore, a smart demand management on the vehicle side can lead to significant cost reductions for the HRS infrastructure. © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

	abstract = {Ultra-fine hydrogen produced by electrochemical water splitting without carbon emission is a high-density energy carrier, which could gradually substitute the usage of traditional fossil fuels. The development of high-performance electrocatalysts at affordable costs is one of the major research priorities in order to achieve the large-scale implementation of a green hydrogen supply chain. In this work, the development of a vanadium-doped FeBP (V-FeBP) microsphere croissant (MSC) electrocatalyst is demonstrated to exhibit efficient bi-functional water splitting for the first time. The FeBP MSC electrode is synthesized by a hydrothermal approach along with the systematic control of growth parameters such as precursor concentration, reaction duration, reaction temperature and post-annealing, etc. Then, the heteroatom doping of vanadium is performed on the best FeBP MSC by a simple soaking approach. The best optimized V-FeBP MSC demonstrates the low HER and OER overpotentials of 52 and 180 mV at 50 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH in a three-electrode system. In addition, the two-electrode system, i.e., V-FeBP || V-FeBP, demonstrates a comparable water-splitting performance to the benchmark electrodes of Pt/C || RuO2 in 1 M KOH. Similarly, exceptional performance is also observed in natural sea water. The 3D MSC flower-like structure provides a very high surface area that favors rapid mass/electron-transport pathways, which improves the electrocatalytic activity. Further, the V-FeBP electrode is examined in different pH solutions and in terms of its stability under industrial operational conditions at 60 °C in 6 M KOH, and it shows excellent stability. © 2022 by the authors.},

The need to manage increased sludge volumes at rising disposal costs, coupled with the recognition of the potential for on-site energy production, have been the key drivers for this recent appeal. With the current political view supporting the development of a renewable-gas industry in Portugal, renewable gases are considered an attractive solution for dewatered-sludge valorization. Moreover, investment in renewable-gas supply chains would help the industry to mature to a level at which the technology and market are rapidly established. Recognizing this interest, dewatered-sludge gasification was selected as a possible valorization pathway, with the potential for hydrogen and bio-SNG production, as well as decentralized heat and power. This document identifies the market opportunities for the establishment of sewage-sludge gasification in Portugal. The analysis starts with a brief overview of the Portuguese water-and-waste sector, and a description of the current status of the renewable-gas markets. Finally, the dewatered-sludge amounts are quantified, and the potential for energy and renewable-gas production is estimated to support the interest in wastewater management in advanced processes, and to pave the way for future feasibility studies. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen production through electrolysis using renewable electricity is considered a major pathway and component for a sustainable energy system of the future. For this production pathway, a high renewable energy potential, especially in solar energy, is crucial. Countries like Germany with a high energy demand and low solar potential strongly depend on hydrogen import. In the present work, a case study with two alternative hydrogen supply options is conducted to evaluate the economic viability of solar hydrogen delivered to a hydrogen pipeline in Stuttgart, Germany. For both options, hydrogen is generated through an 8 MW alkaline electrolyser, solar powered and supported by grid-based electricity to meet the required load. The first option is based on a hydrogen production system that is positioned in Sines, Portugal, an area with high global radiation and proximity to a deep sea port. The hydrogen is processed by liquefaction and transported to Stuttgart by tanker ship via Hamburg and by truck. The second supply option uses an on-site hydrogen production system in Stuttgart. The work shows that the production costs in Sines with 2.09 €/kgH2 (prices in €2021) are, as expected, significantly lower than in Stuttgart with 3.24 €/kgH2. However, this price difference of 1.15 €/kgH2 for hydrogen production drops to a marginal difference of 0.13 €/kgH2 when considering the whole value chain to the delivery point in Stuttgart. If the waste heat from electrolysis is used in a district heating system in Stuttgart, the price difference is down to 0.03 €/kgH2. The first supply option is dominated by costs for processing, especially liquefaction. These costs would need to be reduced to fully exploit the cost advantage of solar hydrogen production in Portugal. Also, a fundamental switch to pipeline transport of gaseous hydrogen should be considered. Both investigated hydrogen supply options show the potential to provide the pipeline in Stuttgart with hydrogen at lower costs than by using the alternative technology of steam reforming of natural gas. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

For an informed decision on choosing vehicles fuelled by either hydrogen or direct electricity, this is a decisive factor which needs to be predicted as accurately as possible for a quite long time in the future, ideally for the lifetime of the intended infrastructure. For supply of green hydrogen, we have considered scenarios that incorporate either a local or domestic production or an import of hydrogen. The hydrogen is assumed to be transported in pressure vessels from the point of generation to the filling station. Also, possible alternative routes via Ammonia or LOHC are indicateded. We furthermore describe a method for TCO optimization for a regional vehicle fleet, which is based on real-world measurements on the vehicle. Measurements have been done on a bus fleet in daily operation with focus on the thermal energy flow, and monitored for an extended period of 2 years in order to cover a wide range of climate and traffic conditions. These data are the basis for a simulation for an operation of battery electric as well as hydrogen vehicles, and the layout of respective infrastructures. © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

The 2019 Prohibition of Electricity Market Misconduct (PEMM) laws are intended to ensure that reductions in electricity supply chain costs are passed on to consumers, that gentailers are not able to discriminate against smaller retailers in financial contracts markets, and that generators are not able to manipulate prices in wholesale spot markets. These laws are broadly formulated, and grant strong powers to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, including the power to apply to the Treasurer for a divestiture of assets order. State and Commonwealth default offers and retail price caps are intended to prevent excessive costs for customers on standing offers, and confusing and misleading offers labelled as discounts. Increasing solar and wind generation capacity is contributing to steadily reducing electricity costs and concentration of ownership. Despite continuing fossil fuel exploitation in Australia, renewable scale-up is likely further accelerate, for production of clean hydrogen to power low-emissions steel and aluminium production, manufacturing and resource processing. Until late 2021, renewable scale-up underpinned reducing wholesale prices, that were not fully reflected in retail prices. In early 2022, electricity wholesale price rises have been driven by surging coal prices, unplanned outages in aging coal plants, and transmission constraints limiting more widespread use of cheaper renewable power. In the event of future wholesale price declines achieved through increasing renewable penetration, the PEMM laws and default offers/price caps can play a useful role in ensuring cost reductions are passed on to consumers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

For example, the European Union aims at achieving this goal by 2050 through actions such as the investment and adoption of hydrogen technologies. Green Hydrogen – meaning hydrogen produced from renewable energies – is expected to play an important role towards a sustainable energy transition as an energy carrier with numerous use applications in transportation, industry, heating, and energy storage. Several experts see it as a viable solution to decarbonize different sectors over time. However, this technology is still in its early stages of development at various points of the supply chain.

	abstract = {This paper deals with a comprehensive feasibility study of green hydrogen production, storage, transportation, and conversion into ammonia as an energy carrier in different locations in Iran with strong wind and solar resources. The feasibility study was conducted in five steps. First, regarding the weather data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest wind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen production facility was modeled for all these locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis requires a considerable amount of water with specific quality and because Iran suffers from water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this regard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is treated in a desalination plant and is sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study intends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping model for the transportation of water, electricity, and ammonia from/to the production site and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using satellite images, and takes into account all pumping/compression stations required to transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia production in Iran and export, considering all related processes involved in the hydrogen supply chain. © Proceedings of ECOS 2022 - 35th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen can be valuable for deep decarbonization of electricity systems as well as energy end-uses where direct electricity is challenged. While most hydrogen supply chain analyses focus on storing hydrogen as compressed gas hydrogen (CGH2) storage, hydrogen storage systems with lower capital cost of storage capacity such as liquefied hydrogen (LH2) and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC) may provide a differentiated value for energy system decarbonization. However, the latter systems have disadvantages (e.g., higher capital cost of charge/discharge capacity, boil-off, high energy requirement for conversion/reconversion) that could impede their deployment. In this study, we expand upon a previously developed electricity-hydrogen infrastructure planning model, DOLPHyN, to explore the value of liquid hydrogen solutions for energy storage and transport in a deeply decarbonized energy system. First, we show that TOL-LOHC (i.e., toluene-based LOHC) and LH2 are beneficial as seasonal energy storage systems, while CGH2 is more suitable for shorter-duration storage (e.g., weekly) cycling. The addition of LH2 and LOHC enables more efficient utilization of deployed electric generation and power-to-hydrogen generation infrastructures. Second, we show that LH2 is more favorable than LOHC for providing long-term storage for the power sector because its primary capital costs and energy penalty for conversion are incurred during charging periods, which typically correspond to when renewable energy is more abundant. Cost effectiveness of LH2 is based on accounting for boil-off rates of large-scale LH2 systems. Third, we show that commercial viability of LOHC is strongly tied to the ability to lower the energetic consumption of the dehydrogenation process as well as its capital cost.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Green methanol could play a major role in decarbonising both the chemical and energy sectors. While techno-economic and environmental studies on green methanol following a life-cycle perspective are available, its social implications from a supply-chain standpoint remain largely unexplored. In order to fill this gap, this work presents the first social life cycle assessment of green methanol produced with CO2 directly captured from the air and hydrogen from wind power electrolysis. When compared to conventional methanol from natural gas, the results suggest an unfavourable performance of green methanol under negative social indicators (forced labour, women in the sectoral labour force, health expenditure, social responsibility promotion, and fair salary) due to the increased supply-chain complexity of the green system. In contrast, green methanol would outperform its conventional counterpart in terms of sectoral contribution to economic development, a positive social indicator which would benefit from the increase in working hours. Besides future consideration of a higher number of positive indicators and potential improvements in country- and sector-specific risk levels towards high-quality social and working conditions, an enhanced social life-cycle performance of green methanol requires technical improvements to reduce the high demand for energy inputs and equipment across its supply chain. Acknowledging decarbonisation as the actual driver of green methanol deployment, future social studies are suggested to focus on the comparison of renewable alternatives for its production and the effect of social regulations. © 2022},

	abstract = {Hydrogen deployment as an energy vector will play a crucial role in the decarbonization of the energy and industrial sectors. Its integration with the energy system requires the development of an adequate delivery infrastructure. The identification of an optimal design and operation strategy is complex due the variety of technological options in each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This work develops a mixed-integer linear programming model to optimize the design and operation of a hydrogen infrastructure, comprising the entire supply chain from production to demand. A crucial novelty element is the combination of technical alternatives and modelling features. The proposed multi-modality formulation optimizes the transport technology at each stage, selecting between pipelines, compressed hydrogen trucks, and liquid hydrogen trucks. The pipeline and road networks are built through the model integration with a Geographic Information System, and the operation is tracked with a daily resolution, following the typical day approach. The model application looks at hydrogen employment for clean mobility in a long-term scenario in the Italian region of Sicily, assuming a demand of 1.1 million equivalent passenger cars (30% of today's stock). The resulting cost-optimal infrastructure features an average cost of delivered hydrogen of 3.81 €/kg, in line with mobility targets. The supply chain relies on the concurrent use of all transport modalities, thus showing that the multiplicity of options is a key asset in the development of a hydrogen economy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {With the proposal of carbon neutrality goals and hydrogen energy development strategies in various countries, the development and construction of hydrogen supply chains have become important priorities. However, existing research has paid little attention to the hydrogen market and pricing. Therefore, a hydrogen pricing method based on marginal pricing theory is proposed in this paper, which adapts to hydrogen systems with renewable-to-hydrogen as a major source, in the future. A hydrogen energy market is established to define the industrial chain of hydrogen and the hydrogen trading process. The hydrogen market-clearing model is formulated considering a dynamic line pack. Due to its nonconvexity, the model is equivalently converted into mixed-integer second-order cone programming, and the optimality gap is minimized by introducing a penalty term. Based on the clearing solution, the concept and calculation method of the locational marginal hydrogen price (LMHP) are proposed with respect to the locational marginal price (LMP) in electricity markets. Case studies based on a modified Belgium 20-node gas network and Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland (PJM) market operation data demonstrate the consistency between LMHP and LMP. © 2015 CSEE.},

This study aims to evaluate the economic and environmental implications of using biomass wastes for energy generation, and its integration to the national energy grid, where the problem is addressed as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), adopting maximization of annual profit, and minimization of greenhouse gas emissions as optimization criteria. Input data is provided by sugar companies and the national transport and energy information platform, and were represented by probability distributions to consider variability in key parameters. Independent solutions show similarities in terms of resource utilization, while also significant differences regarding economic and environmental indicators. Multi-objective optimization was performed by a genetic algorithm (GA). The optimal HSC network configuration is selected using a multi-criteria decision technique, i.e., TOPSIS. An uncertainty analysis is performed, and main economic indicators are estimated by investment assessment. Main results show the trade-off interactions between the HSC elements and optimization criteria.

	abstract = {Contamination of meat with pathogenic microorganisms can cause severe illnesses and food waste, which has significant negative impacts on both general health and the economy. In many cases, the expiration date is not a good indicator of meat freshness as there is a high risk of contamination during handling throughout the supply chain. Many biomarkers, including color, odor, pH, temperature, and volatile compounds, are used to determine spoilage. Among these, pH presents a simple and effective biomarker directly linked to the overgrowth of bacteria and degradation of the meat tissue. Low-cost methods for wireless pH monitoring are crucial in detecting spoilage on a large commercial scale. Existing technologies are often limited to short-range detection, with the use of batteries and different electronic components that increases both the manufacturing complexity and cost of the final device. To address these shortcomings, we have developed a cost-effective wireless pH sensor, which uses passive resonant frequency (RF) sensing, combined with a pH-responsive polymer that can be placed within packaged meat products and provide a remote assessment of the risk of microbial spoilage throughout the supply chain. The sensor tag consists of a sensing resonator coated with a pH-sensitive material and a passivated reference resonator operating in a differential frequency configuration. Upon exposure to elevated pH levels >6.8, the coating on the sensing resonator dissolves, which in turn results in a distinct change in the resonant frequency with respect to the reference resonator. Systematic theoretical and experimental results at different pH levels demonstrated that a 20% shift in resonant frequency demarcates the point for spoilage detection. As a proof of concept, the performance of the sensor in remotely detecting the risk of food spoilage was validated in packaged poultry over 10 days. The sensor fabrication process takes advantage of recent developments in the scalable manufacturing of flexible, low-cost devices, including selective laser etching of metalized plastic films and doctor-blade coating of stimuli-responsive polymer films. Furthermore, the biocompatibility of all the materials used in the sensor was confirmed with human intestinal cells (HCT-8 cells).  © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

While there is still place for centralized production, geographic variation in renewable energy sources and sustainable feedstocks calls for a flexible approach towards smaller-scale and more decentralized production. With the pressing need for decarbonization of power generation and the chemical value chain, flexible manufacturing will play a major role in redefining the energy-chemistry nexus. Intensification and modularization are identified as the key enablers for such a transition. A sample case study based on valorization of hydrogen sulfide extracted from sour gas is presented to demonstrate the potential economic favorability of modular chemical process intensification. Our work shows that a net profit of US$97 million can be achieved over a five-year operational period when compared to a conventional process. A complementary evaluation of green solvents is also provided to further improve the sustainability of the proposed solution. © 2022},

	abstract = {Renewable energy resources have received attention due to concerns about oil depletion and climate change consequences. In the aviation sector, the development of renewable aviation fuel is identified as a promising alternative to replace fossil jet fuel in the current infrastructure. Thus, obtaining the alternative optimal designs to satisfy the upcoming demand has become a crucial factor. Therefore, a mathematical model of biojet fuel production supply, by hydroprocessing inedible oils (such as Jatropha curcas, camelina, palm stearin, and Ricinus communis), was proposed along with renewable hydrogen production (produced from residual biomass in oil extraction). Considering the Mexican airport network, it was possible to identify the best economic scenario with a profit of 16,893,146 USD/y and 27.6% CO2emission reduction, in comparison with fossil jet fuel use. Additionally, the best solutions show that it is possible to satisfy the national jet fuel demand (4,157.5 ktonne/y) with the produced renewable fuel jet and even increase the profit using surplus sales (315 ktonne/y). This is possible with the amount of biomass harvested in 26 states in Mexico, and only 11 biojet fuel production facilities are installed. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, HyForce, the next generation 2 MW hydrogen powered virtual tugboat was designed for a feasibility assessment for her techno-economic and environmental footprint to replace existing diesel-powered tugboats. The study compares the use of hydrogen fuel cells and an internal combustion engine to perform the same dynamic load profile for a typical tugboat mission. The results from the study show that a signpost for commercial competitiveness of HyForce is influenced primarily by the projected liquid hydrogen cost of 5.10 USD per kg in 2040 with a 2,000 USD/kW capital cost for the fuel cells. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from a “well-to-wake” analysis for fossil-based hydrogen and renewable hydrogen supply chains were conducted, and the results show 26.9% and 75.6% reduction, respectively, compared to similar tug running on diesel fuel. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted many industries, in particular the healthcare sector exposing systemic vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, risk mitigation, and supply chain management. A major challenge during the pandemic was related to the increased demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), resulting in critical shortages for healthcare and frontline workers. This is due to the lack of information visibility combined with the inability to precisely track product movement within the supply chain, requiring a robust traceability solution. Blockchain technology is a distributed ledger that ensures a transparent, safe, and secure exchange of data among supply chain stakeholders. The advantages of adopting blockchain technology to manage and track PPE products in the supply chain include decentralized control, security, traceability, and auditable time-stamped transactions. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based approach using smart contracts to transform PPE supply chain operations. We propose a generic framework using Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized storage systems to automate the processes and information exchange and present detailed algorithms that capture the interactions among supply chain stakeholders. The smart contract code was developed and tested in Remix environment, and the code is made publicly available on Github. We present detailed cost and security analysis incurred by the stakeholders in the supply chain. Adopting a blockchain-based solution for PPE supply chains is economically viable and provides a streamlined, secure, trusted, and transparent mode of communication among various stakeholders. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

It emphasized fuel cell commercial vehicles rather than passenger vehicles. Such an emphasis is drastically different from the hydrogen and fuel cell strategies of other leading economies. This study aims at providing insights into the justification behind it. It develops quantitative models to conduct economic assessments of the feasibility of hydrogen energy produced from renewable energy and subsequently applied in the road transport sector in China. A well-to-wheel model is developed to estimate the carbon emissions of the hydrogen supply chain as well as that of the fuel cell electric vehicles. In the meantime, a levelised cost of hydrogen model is adopted to analyze the cost of hydrogen as storage for renewable energy. These are followed by a total cost of ownership model applied to assess the cost of owning and driving fuel cell electric vehicle, fueled by the hydrogen produced from renewables, compared to alternative vehicle powertrains, especially those fossil fuel-based. On such a basis, the relation between energy policies and the competitiveness of hydrogen produced from renewable energy and the fuel cell electric vehicle is discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive approach to design hydrogen supply chains (HSCs) targeting industrial and mobility markets. Even if the inclusion of sustainability criteria is paramount, only a few studies simultaneously consider economic, environmental, and social aspects - the most difficult to measure. In this paper, the safety risk and the social cost-benefit (SCB) have been identified as quantifiable social criteria that would affect society and the end-users. The objectives of this research are (1) to design a sustainable HSC by using four objective functions, i.e., levelized cost of hydrogen, global warming potential, safety risk and social cost-benefit through a mixed-integer linear programming model; (2) to compare results from SCB and multiobjective optimisation. The integration of the SCB criterion at the optimisation stage is not a trivial task and is one of the main contributions of this work. It implies the minimisation of the total cost of ownership (TCO) for buses and trucks. The evolution of the HSC from 2030 to 2050 is studied through a multiobjective and multiperiod optimisation framework using the ε-constraint method. The methodology has been applied to a case study for Hungary with several scenarios to test the sensitivity of demand type and volume as well as the production technology. The results analysis highlights that (1) it is beneficial to have mixed demand (industry and mobility) and a gradual introduction/migration to electrolysis technology and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) for a smooth transition. Liquid hydrogen produced via water electrolysis powered by nuclear and wind energy can result in an average levelized cost of $4.78 and 3.14 kg CO2-eq per kg H2; (2) the frameworks for multiobjective optimisation and SCB maximisation are complementary because they prioritise different aspects to design the HSC. Taxes and surcharges for H2 fuel will impact its final price at the refuelling station resulting in a higher TCO for FCVs compared to diesel buses and trucks in 2030 but the TCO becomes almost competitive for hydrogen trucks from 2035 when SCB is maximised. The SCB function can be refined and easily adapted to include additional externalities. © 2022 The Authors},

Through the proposed method, it is possible to effectively conduct a comprehensive assessment of regional biomass material hydrogen production; moreover, the optimal design of the biomass hydrogen production supply chain can also be determined based on the availability of biomass and hydrogen demand.

	abstract = {Overseas hydrogen transport via ships is crucial to meet the global energy supply as we shift from the carbon-based fuel era. In this study, the hydrogen supply chain, which includes chemical and physical storage processes as well as sea and land transport and terminals, was economically and environmentally investigated. Five different storage technologies (i.e., liquid hydrogen, ammonia, toluene-methylcyclohexane [TOL-MCH], dibenzyltoluene-perhydro-dibenzyltoluene (H0DBT-H18DBT), and methanol) were applied to a defined intercontinental hydrogen supply chain that carries 300,000 t of hydrogen per year via ships. The five hydrogen storage technologies were evaluated and compared based on their economic and environmental performance. To achieve a higher energy efficiency, the models were upgraded by integrating liquid natural gas (LNG) to achieve hydrogen liquefaction and utilizing the waste heat of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Additionally, assuming that renewable energy capacity will be dominant in the future, renewable electricity and green hydrogen usage were investigated. The results showed that the TOL-MCH supply chain is the most cost-effective and environmentally friendly technology with 5.8 $/kgH2 levelized cost and 18.5 kgCO2-eq/kgH2 carbon intensity, followed by the ammonia supply chain, due to its suitable operating conditions. In the case of renewable electricity and green hydrogen dominance, the ammonia supply chain generates the lowest carbon emissions (i.e., 2.23 kgCO2-eq/kgH2) with a cost of 4.92 $/kgH2, and the TOL-MCH chain is the most cost-effective technology (i.e., 4.57 $/kgH2). Therefore, a decrease in process energy consumption and the use of renewable energy sources are essential for efficient and sustainable hydrogen seaborne transport. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Gas used for 183 million tons annual ammonia production represents 4% of total global gas supply. 1.5-degree pathways estimate an ammonia demand growth of 3–4-fold until 2050 as new markets in hydrogen transport, shipping and power generation emerge. Ammonia production from hydrogen produced via water electrolysis with renewable power (green ammonia) and from natural gas with CO2 storage (blue ammonia) is gaining attention due to the potential role of ammonia in decarbonizing energy value chains and aiding nations in achieving their net-zero targets. This study assesses the technical and economic viability of different routes of ammonia production with an emphasis on a systems level perspective and related process integration. Additional cost reductions may be driven by optimum sizing of renewable power capacity, reducing losses in the value chain, technology learning and scale-up, reducing risk and a lower cost of capital. Developing certification and standards will be necessary to ascertain the extent of greenhouse gas emissions throughout the supply chain as well as improving the enabling conditions, including innovative finance and de-risking for facilitating international trade, market creation and large-scale project development. © 2023 by the authors.},

Consequently, this study involves a macro-level view of the entire supply chain, emphasizing how liquefied natural gas exporters can reduce the environmental impact of shipping activities of energy commodities (LNG, hydrogen, ammonia and their blends) through greater uptake of cleaner fuel alternatives. This study tests the notion that demand for alternative fuels will continue to increase as the transportation sector integrates cleaner fuels to comply with increasing environmental regulations. Using Qatar as a case study, linear programming was used to develop a mathematical model where several scenarios are assessed, and the optimal combination of fuels sold, and bunker fuel consumed is determined. Firstly, by looking for maximum profit given the constraints imposed; secondly, by looking for minimal greenhouse gas emissions under the same constraints; and thirdly, by looking for maximum profit and minimum environmental impact. Results demonstrate that cleaner fuels can reduce emissions of maritime industry. While solving for minimal emissions regardless of profit, outcomes suggest that LNG is the most favourable fuel to sell due to the high demand and high production capacity, whereas NH3 is the most favourable for fuelling ships. This solution yielded a significant reduction of CO2 emissions as opposed to that expected from HFO. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is considered to the ultimate solution to achieve carbon emission reduction due to its wide sources and high calorific value, as well as non-polluting, renewable, and storable advantages. This paper starts from the coastal areas, uses offshore wind power hydrogen production as the hydrogen source, and focuses on the combination of hydrogen supply chain network design and hydrogen expressway hydrogen refueling station layout optimization. It proposes a comprehensive mathematical model of hydrogen supply chain network based on cost analysis, which determined the optimal size and location of hydrogen refueling stations on hydrogen expressways in coastal areas. Under the multi-scenario and multi-case optimization results, the location of the hydrogen refueling station can effectively cover the road sections of each case, and the unit hydrogen cost of the hydrogen supply chain network is between 11.8 and 15.0 USD/kgH2. Meanwhile, it was found that the transportation distance and the number of hydrogen sources play a decisive role on the cost of hydrogen in the supply chain network, and the location of hydrogen sources have a decisive influence on the location of hydrogen refueling stations. In addition, carbon emission reduction results of hydrogen supply chain network show that the carbon emission reduction per unit hydrogen production is 15.51 kgCO2/kgH2 at the production side. The CO2 emission can be reduced by 68.3 kgCO2/km and 6.35 kgCO2/kgH2 per unit mileage and per unit hydrogen demand at the application side, respectively. The layout planning utilization of hydrogen energy expressway has a positive impact on energy saving and emission reduction. © 2022 by the authors.},

LCOEs using the international hydrogen transport chains are analyzed in this study to consider economic efficiency and to find effective clues for cost reduction in the international hydrogen transport chains. As preliminary results, we have found that the transportation cost that includes liquefaction, storages and international seaborne transport is improved by about 40% considering the advantages of large-scale facilities and that lignite gasification technologies with carbon capture have a competitive edge under the current assumption.

	abstract = {Green hydrogen finds its vital role in bridging the intermittent supplied renewable energy and fossil fuel infrastructure in a broad energy transition context. The bottleneck still lies in hydrogen's low volumetric energy density, prohibiting long-distance, large-scale, and cost-effective transportation. As a promising hydrogen carrier, ammonia possesses mature production, storage, transportation, and distribution supply chains. These advantages of ammonia enabled the possibility of transforming the renewable hydrogen at a minimum initial cost. This paper investigates the technological and economic feasibility of green ammonia utilization in the Solid Oxide Cells for power generation and energy storage. The result shows that the cost of Ammonia induced energy (183.75 US$/MWh) is significantly higher than that of natural gas power plants (81.77 US$/MWh). The main contributor is the fuel cost. In the optimum case, with fuel costs substantially dropping, the conceptual plant can be highly feasible, and the generated energy (97.40 USS$/MWh) is comparable to the conventional power plant. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

An environmental and cost analysis of a metal hydride (MH) compressor and competing technologies (an air booster and a commercial hydrogen compressor), is performed for an application to fuel cell driven forklifts. The MH compressor shows limited environmental impacts only when a source of waste heat is available for hydrogen desorption. In these case, impacts would be similar to a generic compressor, but larger than those generated by an air booster. The equivalent economic cost is 6 € per kg of compressed hydrogen for the MH compressor, which is much higher than for the air booster, but lower than for a generic hydrogen compressor.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is a potential energy carrier for renewable energy as it has a clean emission when consumed. To implement hydrogen energy system in large-scale, a comprehensive hydrogen supply network should be built to supply the required hydrogen with optimal infrastructure arrangement. Although the optimization of hydrogen gas supply chain has been extensively studied, the investigation into an integrated hydrogen-electricity supply chain is still lacking. Considering the interconvertibility of hydrogen and electricity, this study presents a spatial optimization framework that integrates geographical information with mathematical modeling for the design and optimization of a photovoltaic-based hydrogen-electricity supply chain. The proposed framework allows the concurrent targeting of vehicle fuel and electricity demands as well as the identification of suitable locations for supply chain infrastructures. The case study results show that the minimum cost of hydrogen-electricity supply chain is about 14.9 billion USD/y assuming two days of autonomy, and the cost of battery constitutes 43% of the total supply chain cost. When the days of autonomy is 8 and above, hydrogen storage is preferred and electricity is regenerated from hydrogen using fuel cell.

	abstract = {WSP and KPMG recently developed a digital tool and prospectus for a broad range of hydrogen production and export sites across South Australia for the Government of South Australia. Production sites considered green hydrogen (produced from renewable energy) and blue hydrogen (produced from natural gas), and the export products tested were liquid hydrogen (LH2), ammonia (NH3), and Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs). Production locations were geographically diverse, suiting either greenfield port development or expansion in existing ports. An option selection process based on PIANC Report No. 185 [9] was used. A shipping assessment was completed to determine performance requirements and spatial needs for each export terminal. The different export products resulted in varied infrastructure requirements, with LOHC requiring the most berth and storage infrastructure and NH3 the least. Comparative capital costs were heavily influenced by the available water depth and distance from shore. Comparative operating costs were influenced by exposure, remoteness, and availability of tug services. The study found that port construction costs were a relatively minor component of the hydrogen supply chain with the export terminal typically making up less than 7% of the free on-board cost of hydrogen for a medium or large-scale development. Challenges remain in identifying sites where pilot projects or small-scale developments can be initiated without prohibitive start-up costs, with existing ports likely to require the lowest initial costs but having comparatively low cost-effective production capacity due to the costs of transport and transmission. © 2022 Australasian Coasts and Ports 2021 - Proceedings.

The scope of this study is hence that to define a cost-optimized decarbonization strategy for an energy and carbon intensive industry using an Italian refinery as a case study. The methodology involves the coupling of EnergyPLAN with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA), considering the minimization of annual cost and CO2 emissions as two potentially conflicting objectives and the energy technologies’ capacities as decision variables. For the target year 2025, EnergyPLAN + MOEA has allowed to model a range of 0–100% decarbonization solutions characterized by optimal penetration mix of 22 technologies in the electrical, thermal, hydrogen feedstock and transport demand. A set of nine scenarios, with different land use availabilities and implementable technologies, each consisting of 100 optimal systems out of 10,000 simulated ones, has been evaluated. The results show, on the one hand the possibility of achieving medium-high decarbonization solutions at costs close to current ones, on the other, how the decarbonization pathways strongly depend on the available land for solar thermal, photovoltaic and wind, as well as the presence of a biomass supply chain in the region. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The use of low-carbon hydrogen is being considered to help decarbonize several jurisdictions around the world. There may be opportunities for energy-exporting countries to supply energy-importing countries with a secure source of low-carbon hydrogen. The study objective is to assess the delivered cost of gaseous hydrogen export from Canada (a fossil-resource rich country) to the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and inland destinations in North America. There is a data gap on the feasibility of inter-continental export of hydrogen from an energy-producing jurisdiction to energy-consuming jurisdictions. This study is aimed at addressing this gap and includes an assessment of opportunities across the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, based on fundamental engineering-based models. Techno-economics were used to determine the delivered cost of hydrogen to these destinations. The modelling considers energy, material, and capacity-sizing requirements for a five-stage supply chain comprising hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage, hydrogen pipeline transportation, liquefaction, shipping, and regasification at the destinations. The results show that the delivered cost of hydrogen to inland destinations in North America is between CAD$4.81/kg and CAD$6.03/kg, to the Asia-Pacific from CAD$6.65/kg to CAD$6.99/kg, and at least CAD$8.14/kg for exports to Europe. Delivering hydrogen by blending in existing long-distance natural gas pipelines reduced the delivered cost to inland destinations by 17%. Exporting ammonia to the Asia-Pacific provides cost savings of 28% compared to shipping liquified hydrogen. The developed information may be helpful to policymakers in government and the industry in making informed decisions about international trade of low-carbon hydrogen in both energy-exporting and energy-importing jurisdictions, globally. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The production of iron and steel is one of the largest global sources of industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. South Africa (SA) could competitively export near-zero embodied GHG primary iron to steelmakers in leading decarbonizing markets. A green primary iron production process substitutes hydrogen for coke as the iron ore reductant. A SA plant would enjoy most of its competitive cost advantage from hydrogen produced using very low-cost solar photovoltaic electricity. In import markets, using the European Union (EU) as an example, steelmakers could use imported green primary iron to increase utilization of electric arc furnaces while reducing total EU demand for clean electricity (i.e. for hydrogen for reduction needs) and thereby lower total system costs of decarbonization. SA could bolster crucial export and tax revenues while moving towards a broader transition to a sustainable industry. Three things are needed to unlock new global business models involving the relocating of green primary iron production to regions with abundant renewable energy: (1) a steelmaker with access to a hydrogen reduction technology appropriate for SA’s ores willing and able to invest in a plant; (2) access to a bankable lead market for that plant’s production; and (3) international trade rules and emissions accounting related to the carbon content of commodities that enable the reconfiguration of supply chains to reduce global decarbonization costs. Key policy insights Green primary iron production in SA could increase value added from local iron ore and solar energy resources, bolster exports and initiate transformation to a sustainable industry. Green primary iron imports from SA to the EU could reduce the cost of overall decarbonization while increasing the competitiveness of steel product manufacturing. Enabling conditions include a willing steelmaker, fair access to the EU iron market, enabling trade rules, and embodied emissions certification and accounting. Green primary iron imports can reduce demands on EU low carbon electricity supply, lowering electricity prices and increasing energy security. The collaboration envisioned between the EU and SA could help develop the framework for future inter-regional decarbonization strategies for other commodities and other countries. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

The ramp-up of a hydrogen market is a critical phase, which requires the engagement and coordination of many heterogeneous stakeholders. A better understanding of who these stakeholders are and what relationships, chances, and risks they perceive is crucial to guide a hydrogen market ramp-up. This paper conducts a stakeholder analysis for Germany with a focus on the market ramp-up period. Interviews with 36 hydrogen experts, literature, and stakeholders from 78 real-world hydrogen research and demonstration projects are analysed with qualitative content analysis and social network analysis. In total, 49 stakeholder groups are identified and defined accordingly. The results indicate that established stakeholders’ roles will significantly change in a future hydrogen market. Risks range from economic and supply chain risks to impacts on international policy. Chances are found along economic, ecological, and political dimensions. Political intervention during the market ramp-up should mostly focus on the economic gap between low-carbon hydrogen and fossil alternatives and on prioritising the allocation of scarce hydrogen supply on heterogeneous demand. Simultaneously, a long-term strategy should be envisaged to guarantee a competitive and non-discriminatory hydrogen market in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen has attracted significant global attention as a source of clean energy. With the increasing focus on utilizing hydrogen as a clean fuel, large-scale storage and transportation have emerged as essential parts of the hydrogen supply chain. Liquid hydrogen (LH2) is the most suitable alternative in this regard; additionally, LH2 ensures the purest form of hydrogen. Since hydrogen is primarily produced from fossil-based fuels, its purification is a critical step during LH2 production. Conventionally, pressure swing adsorption is adopted as a purification technique for this purpose. In contrast, cryogenic techniques have the limitations of low purity and recovery. In this study, a unique cryogenic approach with dual advantages, viz. hydrogen enrichment through CO2 solidification and precooling of hydrogen, is adopted. This is the first simulation study conducted on the removal of CO2 from a mixture of H2 and CO2 using anti-sublimation. The proposed process was simulated using Aspen Hysys® V11. The anti-sublimation process was performed in a specially designed chamber equipped with a refrigeration cycle. The anti-sublimation conditions were verified based on the phase behaviors of the H2/CO2 mixture and pure CO2. The purified and precooled hydrogen was liquified using three refrigeration cycles. The overall specific energy consumption of the proposed process is 9.62 kWh/kg, which is lower than those of commercial LH2 production processes. Moreover, the high exergy efficiency (31.5%) favors this unique approach of hydrogen enrichment and liquefaction. The economic analysis of the proposed process revealed a total acquisition cost (TAC) of 52.8 mil $/y.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is recognized as a key element of future low-carbon energy systems. For proper integration, an adequate delivery infrastructure will be required, to be deployed in parallel to the electric grid and the gas network. This work adopts an optimization model to support the design of a future hydrogen delivery infrastructure, considering production, storage, and transport up to demand points. The model includes two production technologies, i.e., steam reforming with carbon capture and PV-fed electrolysis systems, and three transport modalities, i.e., pipelines, compressed hydrogen trucks, and liquid hydrogen trucks. This study compares a multi-modality formulation, in which the different transport technologies are simultaneously employed and their selection is optimized, with a mono-modality formulation, in which a single transport technology is considered. The assessment looks at the regional case study of Lombardy in Italy, considering a long-term scenario in which an extensive hydrogen supply chain is developed to supply hydrogen for clean mobility. Results show that the multi-modality infrastructure provides significant cost benefits, yielding an average cost of hydrogen that is up to 11% lower than a mono-modality configuration. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {The search for alternative fuel sources to replace non-renewable energy is a highly relevant topic in current research studies. Both biomethane and biohydrogen can be obtained from several anaerobic biological processes, which have some advantages over traditional energy supply chains, especially due to the ability to use various wastes and/or wastewaters as feedstock for the biogas production, which is considered a renewable fuel. These features combined with low energy inputs support the potential of these processes to play a key role in replacing fossil energy sources in the coming decades, as well as helping to avoid climate changes. Thus, it is essential to accurately determine the composition of the biogas generated in different biological processes, regardless of the application: from lab-scale studies to industrial plants. In this work, a gas chromatography set consisting of a Shimadzu/TCD GC-2030 equipped with a Supelco Carboxen 1010PLOT column was used to determine hydrogen (H2), nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4) and dioxide carbon (CO2) by a low-cost manual injection procedure”. Two analytical curves (low and high ranges) were obtained for each target, which enables analysing biogas containing low and high concentrations of the targets. The validation parameters evaluated, namely, [i] linearity, working range, linear working range and sensitivity; [ii] limit of detection (LOD); [iii] limit of quantification (LOQ); and [iv] precision, expressed through repeatability and intermediate precision attested the reliability of the method for numerous applications. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Several crises have gripped the world, clearly showing how vulnerable our energy supply is. However, emissions from industrial and energy applications have threatened our future with climate change. There is a need to redesign our strategies on energy policies. The present energy generation methods have sustained us for a long time, but they seem unsustainable for future energy demands. This energy supply and production could soon collapse if it keeps going on. It will affect not only humans but the whole planet. The primary purpose of this study is to look for new ideas that will help us produce ample energy and consider their impacts on the environment. We could alleviate this energy deficiency problem by involving the frequent use of renewable energy technologies as they do not rely on fuels and seem eco-friendly. However, before initiating any project, their impact on the environment needs extensive research. Some of the possible improvements in some present methods of energy generation were studied and mentioned. The improvement in materials used for energy applications could result in enhanced efficiency. Despite the technological advances we have, there are many challenges before us. Efficiencies of renewable energy technologies could be increased by upgrading the required equipment and infrastructure. Ensuring a mix of reliable energy production methods and ensuring minimal impact on the environment would lead us in the future. Resilient and efficient energy production will sustain our future energy demands at a low cost. Hydrogen can be viewed as an alternative fuel. It contains the highest energy content per unit weight and should be included in energy applications. There is no doubt that another war or crisis would severely affect fossil fuel-based economies. Because of such concerns, the global trend of using fossil fuels has changed. Increasingly, countries are investing in other renewable energy sources. Several challenges await us before we can implement the new changes to our energy infrastructure. In an uncertain future, our priority should be how to produce enough clean energy. The time has come to create new plans for the future of energy, minimize carbon emissions and consider the environmental consequences of these actions. There are many questions regarding climate change and energy supply which we will be covering in this report. © 2022},

Leading economies like Japan, South Korea, China, the United States of America, Germany, and Australia are steadily pushing for greater hydrogen integration into their energy systems. Australia's thrust on the hydrogen economy becomes prominent with clear strategic actions to enhance clean technology-based hydrogen production. The paper critically analyses Australia's strategies and policies to expand its hydrogen economy. The paper found that Australia fixed ambitious targets to increase hydrogen penetration in the domestic market and export to Japan, China, and South Korea. Australia's national hydrogen strategy emphasized creating a strong hydrogen value chain to capitalize on abundant renewable resources. This article affirms that Australia has enormous potential for cost-competitive green hydrogen production and export. Australia's cost-competitive green hydrogen production with modern supply chain infrastructure will offer competitive advantages over the other exporters. States/regions are trying to align their hydrogen policies and strategies along the lines of the national strategy. However, some concerns demand timely attention from the stakeholders. Australia should address multiple challenges, including a lack of investment, lower public awareness, and insufficient infrastructure to push hydrogen adoption in the domestic market. Further, Australia must utilize its strengths to take advantage of the emerging hydrogen markets in Japan, China, and South Korea.

	abstract = {Solar thermal technology can provide the United Arab Emirates and the Middle East region with abundant clean electricity to mitigate the rising levels of carbon dioxide and satisfy future demand. Hydrogen can play a key role in the large-scale application of solar thermal technologies, such as concentrated solar plants, in the region by storing the surplus electricity and exporting it to needed countries for profit, placing the Middle East and the United Arab Emirates as major future green hydrogen suppliers. However, a hydrogen supply chain comparison between hydrogen from CSP and other renewable under the UAE’s technical and economic conditions for hydrogen export is yet to be fully considered. Therefore, in this study we provide a techno-economic analysis for well-to-ship solar hydrogen supply chain that compares CSP and PV technologies with a solid oxide water electrolyzer for hydrogen production, assuming four different hydrogen delivery pathways based on the location of electrolyzer and source of electricity, assuming the SOEC can be coupled to the CSP plant when placed at the same site or provided with electric heaters when placed at PV plant site or port sites. The results show that the PV plant achieves a lower levelized cost of electricity than that of the CSP plant with 5.08 ¢/kWh and 8.6 ¢/kWh, respectively. Hydrogen production results show that the scenario where SOEC is coupled to the CSP plant is the most competitive scenario as it achieves the payback period in the shortest period compared to the other scenarios, and also provides higher revenues and a cheaper LCOH of 7.85 $/kgH2. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Today's energy recourses are not supposed to be sufficient to fulfill increased energy demand in the near future, thus researchers and governments look forwards to alternative energy sources. Hydrogen energy is one of these alternative energies. To increase the use of hydrogen energy, it is essential to establish a good hydrogen supply chain (HSC), which provides the transmission of hydrogen from production facilities to the users. There are several key issues which must be addressed in establishing a good HSC like capital cost and operating costs, environmental effects like CO2 emission, and risks. Although minimizing the total costs or total CO2 emissions can be appropriate for a country, minimizing the cumulative risk may result in an unbalanced risk load between cities or grids of a country. In this study we analyze establishing the HSC of Turkey and showed that minimization of total risk yields low risks in grids with low population and grids with higher populations have to cope with larger risks. © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

	abstract = {Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology is expected to support net-zero targets by supplying low carbon energy while providing carbon dioxide removal (CDR). BECCS is estimated to deliver 20 to 70 MtCO2 annual negative emissions by 2050 in the UK, despite there are currently no BECCS operating facility. This research is modelling and demonstrating the flexibility, scalability and attainable immediate application of BECCS. The CDR potential for two out of three BECCS pathways considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios were quantified (i) modular-scale CHP process with post-combustion CCS utilising wheat straw and (ii) hydrogen production in a small-scale gasifier with pre-combustion CCS utilising locally sourced waste wood. Process modelling and lifecycle assessment were used, including a whole supply chain analysis. The investigated BECCS pathways could annually remove between −0.8 and −1.4 tCO2e tbiomass−1 depending on operational decisions. Using all the available wheat straw and waste wood in the UK, a joint CDR capacity for both systems could reach about 23% of the UK's CDR minimum target set for BECCS. Policy frameworks prioritising carbon efficiencies can shape those operational decisions and strongly impact on the overall energy and CDR performance of a BECCS system, but not necessarily maximising the trade-offs between biomass use, energy performance and CDR. A combination of different BECCS pathways will be necessary to reach net-zero targets. Decentralised BECCS deployment could support flexible approaches allowing to maximise positive system trade-offs, enable regional biomass utilisation and provide local energy supply to remote areas. © 2022 The Authors},

The proposed HSC includes existing infrastructure for byproduct hydrogen and natural gas (NG) pipelines. We determined the economic benefits of utilizing NG pipelines and byproduct hydrogen and how existing infrastructure outperformed other technologies for the optimization of the HSC. Compared to the non-utilization scenario, the average levelized costs of hydrogen decreased by 0.93, 1.40, and 2.03 $/kg–H2 if byproduct hydrogen, NG pipelines, or both were available, respectively, in the HSC. The optimal HSC networks indicate that NG pipelines and byproduct hydrogen have synergetic effects on reducing the total costs owing to the decentralization of production facilities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Decarbonization of the fuel sector is crucial to achieving a zero-carbon economy. Both hydrogen and methanol are promising solutions to contribute to this goal. Herein, a comprehensive well-to-pump (WTP) energetic, environmental and economic (3E) assessment for various methanol and hydrogen production pathways is conducted based on the GREET software and data for China. Energy efficiency, levelized cost of fuel, direct and indirect emission, as well as other midpoint environmental impact indicators are compared. The gaseous and liquid hydrogen are produced from coal gasification (CGT), coal coking (CCT), natural gas reforming, and alkaline water electrolysis by renewable and grid electricity. Methanol production pathways include CGT, CCT and CO2 hydrogenation. The results indicate that most methanol produced from CO2 hydrogenation as well as green H2 yield environmental benefits but also entail energy efficiency loss. Specifically, compared to conventional methanol, hydrogen and green hydrogen, the environmental benefits increase by up to 101%, 103% and 104%, whereas the energy efficiency drops by up to 71%, 75% and 85%, respectively. With current technology, the levelized costs of methanol production can be between 12% and 75% lower than most hydrogen production pathways. Compared to hydrogen supply chain, the levelized cost of methanol supply is primarily concentrated in the production stage (67%∼93%). In general, although hydrogen can be an important carbon emission free fuel in the long run, methanol produced from CO2 hydrogenation assisted by renewable sources is the most feasible near-term pathway in China, offering an easier to market carbon neutral fuel source. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Japan was chosen as a case study since we believe that it is the only pioneer country in that chain with a national strategy, investments, and current projects, which make it unique in this way. The analyses include evaluations of clean energy development, power supply chains, regional energy planning, and renewable energy development, including the internal and external elements that may influence the growth of the hydrogen economy in Japan. The ability of Japan to produce and use large quantities of clean hydrogen at a price that is competitive with fossil fuels is critical to the country’s future success. The implementation of an efficient carbon tax and carbon pricing is also necessary for cost parity. There will be an increasing demand for global policy coordination and inter-industry cooperation.

	abstract = {Hydrogen produced using fossil fuel feedstocks causes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, even when carbon capture and storage (CCS) is used. By contrast, hydrogen produced using electrolysis and zero-emissions electricity does not create GHG emissions. Several countries advocating the use of ‘clean’ hydrogen put both technologies in the same category. Recent studies and strategies have compared these technologies, typically assuming high carbon capture rates, but have not assessed the impact of fugitive emissions and lower capture rates on total emissions and costs. We find that emissions from gas or coal based hydrogen production systems could be substantial even with CCS, and the cost of CCS is higher than often assumed. Carbon avoidance costs for high capture rates are notable. Carbon prices of $22–46/tCO2e would be required to make hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCS competitive with hydrogen produced from fossil fuels without CCS. At the same time there are indications that electrolysis with renewable energy could become cheaper than fossil fuel with CCS options, possibly in the near-term future. Establishing hydrogen supply chains on the basis of fossil fuels, as many national strategies foresee, may be incompatible with decarbonisation objectives and raise the risk of stranded assets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The International Maritime Organization (IMO) established new strategies that could lead to a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of the shipping sector to address global warming. A major factor in achieving this goal is transitioning to renewable fuels. This implies a challenge, as not only ship-innovative solutions but also a complete low-carbon fuel supply chain must be implemented. This work provides a method enabling the exploration of the potential of low-carbon fuel technologies for specific shipping routes up to larger sea regions. Several aspects including vessel sizes, impact of weather and shipping routes, emissions savings and costs are considered. The local energy use is determined with proven bottom-up prediction methods based on ship positioning data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) in combination with weather and ship technical data. This methodology was extended by an approach to the generation of a basic low-carbon fuel system topology that enables the consideration of local demand profiles. The applicability of the proposed approach is discussed at hand via a case study on Roll-on/Roll-off passenger and cargo (RoPax) ferries transitioning from conventional fuels to a compressed hydrogen fuel system. The results indicate a potential reduction in emissions by up to 95% and possible system sizes and costs. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This study was planned to offer the roadmap for lifecycle clean shipping by addressing the fundamental question of ‘what are the promising energy solutions for the shipping sector?’. This goal was attempted to be achieved by a lifecycle comparative analysis of the viability of three zero-carbon fuels, ammonia, hydrogen, and inland electricity, based on the operational practicality as well as Well-to-Wake environmental impacts. Credible business scenarios were designed with a high-level screening of 27 short-route ferries currently engaged in 26 West-Scotland coastal routes. Then a series of comparative analyses between the diesel and the proposed alternative fuel sources was conducted. While carbon-free fuels are in the early stages of development in the UK, there are various views on how these fuels can be produced, distributed, and used onboard for the clean shipping economy. To determine the optimal energy solutions, all credible scenarios for the upstream pathways for these fuels were developed, based on the current and future prospected UK energy infrastructure and grids. Those scenarios were examined for West-Scotland shipping and extended to the UK targets. Their technical aspects for maritime application were also investigated in consideration of safety, regulation, infrastructural availability, supply chain constraints, barriers, and the downstream emission pathways to their uptake onboard. Ship conceptual designs were briefly conducted to evaluate the systems, technologies, and equipment required for onboard installation to utilise zero-carbon fuels. As a result of the study, when hydrogen was used as a fuel in fuel cells and electricity was supplied as a backup from batteries that store inland power and the solar PV system, GHG emissions were 25.7% of the conventional fossil fuel-using scenario. In addition, it was confirmed that GWP was 22.2% compared to MGO when ammonia was used as fuel without reforming into hydrogen and backup power was supplied from batteries and the solar PV system. It is believed that the analysis results can distinctively demonstrate the adequacy or the inadequacy of current maritime policies for decarbonising shipping. This research finally provides potential solutions for future UK maritime environmental protection and for enhancing the competitiveness of ship owners. In addition, this research concept can serve as a sample that suggests the direction of ideal research for future energy solutions in the marine sector. © 2022},

This paper reviews the status of hydrogen strategies and progress in major global economies investing in hydrogen, and then focus on four jurisdictions (Japan, Germany, S.

In contrast, California has been more focused on spurring hydrogen demand, especially in the transportation sector. Japan's strategy involves forging partnerships to import “blue” hydrogen while Germany has focused on “green” hydrogen production, along with plans to leverage its extensive natural gas pipelines for hydrogen distribution. Japan anticipates the power sector to be the largest consumer of hydrogen, while others expect the transportation and industry sectors to be the prime movers of future hydrogen demand. Japan, S. Korea and Germany will likely import a substantial portion of their future hydrogen supplies, while California has the potential for low-cost hydrogen production but establishing the distributional infrastructure continues to be a challenge. In all four jurisdictions, investments are still small and there exists huge opportunities for cooperation to develop a self-sustaining global hydrogen market. © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

	abstract = {Green hydrogen supply chain includes supply sources, production, and distribution of hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources (RES). It is a promising scientific and application area, as it is related to the problem of instability of power grids supplied with RES. The article presents the conceptual assumptions of the research on the design of a functional multi-criteria model of the stabilization model architecture of energy distribution networks based on a hydrogen energy buffer, taking into account the applicable use of hydrogen. The aim of the research was to identify the variables contributing to the stabilization of the operation of distribution networks. The method used to obtain this result was a systematic review of the literature using the technique of in-depth analysis of full-text articles and expert consultations. The concept of a functional model was described as a matrix in two dimensions in which the identified variables were embedded. The first dimension covers the phases of the supply chain: procurement and production along with storage and distribution. The second dimension divides the separate factors into technical, economic, and logistic. The research was conducted in the context of system optimization from the point of view of the operator of the energy distribution system. As a result of the research, several benefits resulting from stabilization using a hydrogen buffer were identified. Furthermore, the model may be used in designing solutions stabilizing the operation of power grids in which there are surpluses of electricity produced from RES. Due to the applied multidimensional approach, the developed model is recommended for use, as it enables the design of solutions in a systemic manner. Due to the growing level of energy obtained from renewable energy sources, the issue of stabilizing the energy network is becoming increasingly important for energy network distributors. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Biological methanation (biomethanation) of syngas obtained from biomass gasification offers the opportunity to employ a low-pressure, low-temperature process to produce storable bio-derived substitute natural gas (bSNG), although its economic viability is limited by high energy and biomass costs. Research on syngas biomethanation techno-economic performance is limited and novel biomass-to-biomethane process configurations are required in order to assess opportunities for the enhancement of its efficiency and economic feasibility. In this study, we carried out the techno-economic modeling of two processes comprising integrated biomass gasification, electrolysis, and syngas biomethanation with combined heat and power recovery in order to assess and compare their fuel yields, energy efficiency, carbon efficiency, and bSNG minimum selling price (MSP). The first process operates standalone biomethanation (SAB) of syngas and can produce approximately 38,000 Nm3 of bSNG per day, with a total plant efficiency of 50.6%. The second process (integrated biomethane-biomethanol, IBB) exploits the unconverted carbon stream from the biomethanation process to recover energy and synthesize methanol via direct catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. In addition to the same bSNG output, the IBB process can produce 10 t/day of biomethanol, at a 99% purity. The IBB process shows little global energy efficiency gains in comparison with SAB (51.7%) due to the large increase in electrolytic hydrogen demand, but it shows a substantial improvement in biomass-to-fuel carbon efficiency (33 vs. 26%). The SAB and IBB processes generate a bSNG MSP of 2.38 €/Nm3 and 3.68 €/Nm3, respectively. Hydrogenation of unconverted carbon in biomass-to-biomethane processes comes with high additional capital and operating costs due to the large-scale electrolysis plants required. Consequently, in both processes, the market price gap of the bSNG produced is 0.13 €/kWhbSNG (SAB) and 0.25 €/kWhbSNG (IBB) even under the most optimistic cost scenarios considered, and it is primarily influenced by the cost of surplus electricity utilized in electrolysis, while the selling price of biomethanol exerts a very limited influence on process economics. Intensive subsidization would be required in order to sustain the decentralized production of bSNG through both processes. Despite their limited economic competitiveness, both processes have a size comparable with existing renewable gas production plants in terms of bSNG production capacity and the IBB process is of a size adequate for the supply of biomethanol to a decentralized biorenewable supply chain. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Decarbonised steel, enabled by green hydrogen-based iron ore reduction and renewable electricity-based steel making, will disrupt the traditional supply chain. Focusing on the energetic and techno-economic assessment of potential green supply chains, this study investigates the direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace production route enabled by renewable energy and deployed in regional settings. The hypothesis, that co-locating manufacturing processes with renewable energy resources would offer highest energy efficiency and cost reduction, is tested through an Australia-Japan case study. The binational partnership is structured to meet Japanese steel demand (for domestic use and regional exports) and source both energy and iron ore from the Pilbara region of Western Australia. A total of 12 unique supply chains differentiated by spatial configuration, timeline and energy carrier were simulated, which validated the hypothesis: direct energy and ore exports to remote steel producers (i.e. Japan-based production), as opposed to co-locating iron and steel production with abundant ore and renewable energy resources (i.e. Australia-based production), increased energy consumption and the levelised cost of steel by 45% and 32%, respectively, when averaged across 2030 and 2050. Two decades of technological development and economies of scale realisation would be crucial; 2030 supply chains were on average 12% more energy-intense and 23% more expensive than 2050 equivalents. On energy vectors, liquefied hydrogen was more efficient than ammonia for export-dominant supply chains due to the pairing of its process flexibility and the intermittent solar energy profile, as well as the avoidance of the need for ammonia cracking prior to direct reduction. To mitigate the green premium, a carbon tax in the range of A$66–192/t CO2 would be required in 2030 and A$0–70/t CO2 in 2050; the diminished carbon tax requirement in the latter is achievable only by wholly Australia-based production. Further, the modelled system scale was immense; producing 40 Mtpa of decarbonised steel will require 74–129% of Australia's current electricity output and A$137–328 billion in capital investment for solar power, production, and shipping vessel infrastructure. These results call for strategic planning of regional resource pairing to drive energy and cost efficiencies which accelerate the global decarbonisation of steel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The mining sector contributes to 4–7 % of global GHG emissions, of which 1 % are from scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, caused by operations such as electricity consumption used for the mining process. China heavily relies on coal for power generation, and the energy demand for coal production in the country is primarily met by fossil-based electricity. In addition, the transportation of the mined coal to various destinations within the supply chain is achieved by fossil fuel-powered transport systems. These daily activities of the Chinese coal sector further compound foreign and domestic pressure on China to limit its carbon emissions. The current study attempts to provide a solution to the situation by investigating the feasibility of adopting renewable energy sources for the process of coal mining in Northern China. The selected coal mine is one out of 643 coal mines in Shanxi Province, with a combined production capacity of ∼1 billion tonnes of coal per annum. In addition, the excess electricity generated has been designated to produce hydrogen on-site as a refueling source for hydrogen fuelled-trucks to replace diesel fuelled-trucks in transporting coal. The analysis has been completed using HOMER Pro software, and the key contributions are summarized as follows. 4 different scenarios comprising of standalone solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, and diesel generator have been designed in the current study to serve a daily load of 215 MWh and 2.4 t of electricity for coal mining and hydrogen for transport of 100 % of the mined coal by road using hydrogen fuel cell trucks, respectively. A technical, economic, environmental, and social feasibility analysis have been investigated in the present work. A grid-tied system is subsequently added to the base scenario and the results are compared against the base system in an attempt to identify the more feasible option between the two systems. Also, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to reveal the performance of the base system amidst future uncertainties. The findings in the current work could prove beneficial to China's quest to reach carbon peak by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. © 2022},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to identify the techno-economic factors for the recent hydrogen production pathways and their relevant infrastructures so that the costs reported in the recent articles be easily identified for further analysis. The comparison of the levelised cost of hydrogen production (LCOH) from the steam reforming process and renewable electricity-based electrolysis processes has shown that process efficiency improvement, feedstock price and requirement of scaling up of newer investments are the key areas of attention. Very efficient technical development is yet to implement to offer LCOH of less than 2 USD/kg H2 from any of these technologies along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) or scaling up the low-cost renewable electricity facilities. To facilitate rapid growth in development, the LCOH reported by one project can turn into input to another project of the supply chain system through following common standards. Scaling-up is also essential as the industries requiring more than 100 tonnes of H2 per day can be benefited from integrating the solar PV, grid excess electricity and CCS coupled electricity generation from fossil fuels if the identified techno-economic barriers are solved based on the targeted LCOH. Lower LCOH will encourage the end-users to adopt the newer technology for energy production, which will effectively manage the environmental sustainability targets. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Japan has the third-largest geothermal resource in the world. Geothermal power generation is one of the renewable energy sources being an excellent energy source with a stable supply. Unfortunately, however, commercialization has been delayed due to several reasons. Because geothermal power generation facilities are in mountainous areas, the capacity of the power grid is often insufficient. In addition, since the development period is rather long, the capacity of the commercial power grid to apply for the feed-in tariff (FIT) gets filled earlier by other renewable energy projects which require a mere short development period. Accordingly, there exists difficulty for geothermal power to be connected to the transmission line. Therefore, we considered promoting the use of green hydrogen and establishing its economic efficiency along with the development of geothermal power generation. This project demonstrated a scheme in which hydrogen produced by geothermal power in Oita Prefecture is transported to various parts of Kyushu by land. © 2022 Proceedings of WHEC 2022 - 23rd World Hydrogen Energy Conference: Bridging Continents by H2.

	abstract = {In the past decades, H2 has attracted significant attention as a potentially low, zero, or negative-emissions fuel depending on how it is produced. However, how H2 will evolve in terms of its production, demand, and transport is not very clear. To help fill this gap, we developed a Python-based tool called the Hydrogen Economy Assessment & Resource Tool (HEART), specifically focused on the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region. The tool consists of three parts: a user-friendly GUI, a default database consisting of costs and emissions for various supply/demand pathways, and an analysis and optimization engine. Users can use the default data and/or user inputs to run case studies for insightful results. The analysis and optimization engine can carry out techno-enviro-economic analysis for H2 production and H2 transport, project H2 demand, and carry out the optimization and planning of H2 supply chain over a long-term period. In this paper, we introduce the framework of HEART, the workflow of various projects, and show the capabilities and strengths of HEART through a case study. The case study indicates the tool can provides many useful results, like the landed cost and carbon footprint of H2. Most importantly, by using HEART, H2 supply chain pathways to meet projected demand can be obtained and optimized for total cost or total emissions. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Hydrogen can contribute substantially to the reduction of carbon emissions in industry and transportation. However, the production of hydrogen through electrolysis creates interdependencies between hydrogen supply chains and electricity systems. Therefore, as governments worldwide are planning considerable financial subsidies and new regulation to promote hydrogen infrastructure investments in the next years, energy policy research is needed to guide such policies with holistic analyses. In this study, we link an electrolytic hydrogen supply chain model with an electricity system dispatch model. We use this methodology for a cross-sectoral case study of Germany in 2030. We find that hydrogen infrastructure investments and their effects on the electricity system are strongly influenced by electricity prices. Given current uniform single-prices in Germany, hydrogen production increases congestion costs in the electricity grid by 17%. In contrast, passing spatially resolved electricity price signals leads to electrolyzers being placed at low-cost grid nodes and further away from consumption centers. This causes lower end-use costs for hydrogen. Moreover, congestion management costs decrease substantially, by up to 20% compared to the benchmark case without hydrogen. These savings could be transferred into according subsidies for hydrogen production. Thus, our study demonstrates the benefits of differentiating economic signals for hydrogen production based on spatial criteria. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This paper proposes a planning model for the hydrogen supply chain and a hydrogen pricing method based on the geographical distribution characteristics of renewable energy source bases. First, the normalized hydrogen production station and hydrogen refueling terminal are planned according to the geographical distribution of local renewable energy stations. Secondly, a route model is established to realize the interconnection between the hydrogen production station and the hydrogen refueling terminal. The actual installed capacity of wind and photovoltaic stations is used as the optimization parameter of each normalized hydrogen production station. The hydrogen demand of each hydrogen refueling station is set according to the local population. Finally, with the equilibrium of supply and demand flow of each normalized hydrogen production station and refueling station in the supply chain as the constraints, a planning model with the goal of the lowest hydrogen retail benchmark price is established. Then, a pricing method for the base price of hydrogen is proposed according to the results of planning optimization. The model and method proposed in this paper are verified and analyzed by constructing an example based on the geographical distribution characteristics of renewable energy bases in Qinghai Province. The results show that the method can provide a valuable reference for hydrogen supply chain planning and benchmark hydrogen pricing.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen will play a key role in the future energy transition to achieve the main decarbonization goals. However, many large economies have limited renewable energy generation capacity, which leads to the identification of strategic sites for the global export of hydrogen. The aim of this work is to investigate the techno-economic feasibility of green hydrogen production in Argentine Patagonia with subsequent ship transport to Italy. The study includes the entire supply chain, from the production of hydrogen with renewable energy sources to its final use as a fuel for mobility in Italy. Different scenarios have been identified and compared, considering that the hydrogen production can take place directly in Italy or in Patagonia, followed by a transport to Italy. It was assumed that hydrogen is produced through PEM electrolyzers powered by wind energy. Various hydrogen transport and storage methods were analyzed to assess which is the most cost-effective solution. In addition, the influence of wind capacity factor and electricity cost on the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) was analyzed to provide an in-depth comparative assessment of the two production scenarios. Even considering the additional transport costs from Argentina to Italy, the scenario with hydrogen production in Patagonia was found to be more convenient than the production in Italy. This is due to the high wind potential in Patagonia, where the average wind capacity factor is about 50% compared to 25% in Italy. The minimum LCOH was obtained considering the storage and transport of hydrogen by means of liquid organic hydrogen carriers, with a final cost of 8.60 €/kgH2 and 11.17 €/kgH2 for the Argentine and Italian production scenarios, respectively. The results of the complete supply chains were analyzed step by step, and the reasons behind the most competitive option elucidated in detail. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The objective implicit in the Paris Agreement, net-zero emissions around mid-century, has transformed the debate about heavy industry decarbonisation. Prior to Paris, the iron and steel, cement and concrete, chemicals, and other materials sectors were expected to reduce absolute emissions by perhaps half by 2050, through measures like energy efficiency, biofuels and carbon capture and storage. Global net-zero emissions means that these industries face far deeper transformation and potentially costly offsetting. It is also becoming clear, however, that very low emissions in heavy industry are technically possible using a spectrum of new options, including demand management, materials efficiency, and direct and green hydrogen-based electrification of primary materials production, facilitated by the falling cost of renewable electricity. Very low emissions production chains mean changes to the location of the world's heavy industry, including splitting processes into components to allow use of large-scale low-cost renewable energy or access to geological CO2 storage, with implications for trade. Existing models used for decarbonisation analysis typically do not represent the detail necessary for a full understanding of the range of mitigation options. Better representation of industry in systems modelling, along with analysis and learning about policy options and sequencing as industry transformations unfold, will be important for reaching net-zero and net-negative emissions in cost-effective and just ways. Key options, implications for the geography of heavy industry, and implications for systems modelling and policy are outlined here. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

One of the central social indicators of performance is the impact on health caused by pollution and accidents. Hereby apart from impacts originating from cars as such also the contributions from energy supply chains are accounted for. Cars are assumed to operate in Switzerland. The analysis concerns both current cars (reference year 2019) and future cars (reference year 2050). A variety of fuels and drives are considered including internal combustion vehicles with petrol, diesel and natural gas, hybrid and plug-in-hybrid vehicles, battery vehicles with different sources of charging electricity and fuel cell cars with different ways to produce hydrogen. In the future case the assessment employs Swiss-specific and global energy supply scenarios corresponding to aggressive climate protection policy and the baseline case. For the assessment of health impact of normal operation Life Cycle Assessment and Impact Pathway Approach are used. The latter is a semi-regionalized approach enabling location-dependent modeling of vehicle emissions and corresponding impacts. In the accident context we base our analysis on the statistical records for car accidents, on our database ENSAD providing historical accident records relevant for energy chains and in selected cases on our earlier probabilistic risk assessments of nuclear and hydro power plants. The paper will provide a comparison of the normal operation and accident contributions to health impacts caused by different types of current and future cars with the associated energy supply chains. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

	abstract = {Petroleum products are produced as co-products of crude oil, and several kinds of petrochemical products are produced through petroleum-related products, where huge and complex supply chains exist. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) developed plans for reductions in air pollution in the international bunker under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Convention, as well as requests for CO2 emission reductions under the Paris Agreement. In addition, automobiles are expected to reduce energy consumption and switch fuel sources from oil to electricity or hydrogen, for example. From the energy supply perspective, technological developments in hydrogen, biorefinery, and Carbon dioxide Capture and Utilization (CCU) are in progress, as well as the increasing trend for shale gas. This study consistently analyzes measures in the oil refinery and petrochemical sectors by using a global energy systems model considering these complex conditions. The SOx and NOx emission regulations by the IMO will have a large impact, and the additional global costs are estimated to be about 7–9 billion and 13-14 billion US$2000/year in the years 2030 and 2050, respectively. However, the long-term CO2 emission reduction constraints under the Paris Agreement will have much larger impacts on the oil refinery and petrochemical sectors, particularly after the middle of the 21st Century, and the impacts of SOx and NOx regulations will be relatively small. In order to meet the SOx and NOx regulations by the IMO, the countermeasures both of using high sulfur fuel oil with installing scrubbers etc. and switching to low sulfur fuel oil are cost-efficient. In the long term, liquified natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen, which also contribute to CO2 emission reductions, can be cost-efficient too. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The transportation sector has been the largest contributor to emissions and pollution in Canada. Climate and public health have been negatively affected by the consumption of fossil fuels by conventional vehicles. The rollout of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) has not yet occurred due to a conundrum. Specifically, a refueling infrastructure is required for the mass deployment of FCEVs, but the commercialization of FCEVs is required for investments, thus leading to the question of which will be required first, vehicle commercialization or hydrogen refueling stations. This paper develops a multi-objective model to determine the optimal sizes and locations of the hydrogen infrastructure needed to generate and distribute hydrogen for the key Highway Corridor (HWY 401) in Ontario. The model is used to aid the early-stage transition plan for the conversion of conventional vehicles to FCEVs in Ontario by proposing a feasible solution to the infrastructure dilemma posed by the initial adoption of hydrogen as fuel in the general market. The health benefit from the pollution reduction is also determined to show the potential social and economic incentives of using FCEVs. The results show that hydrogen production and delivery cost can reduce from $22.7/kg H2 in a 0.1% market share scenario to $14.7/kg H2 in a 1% market share scenario. The environmental and health benefit of developing hydrogen refueling infrastructure for heavy-duty vehicles is 1.63 million dollar per year and 1.45 million dollars per year, respectively. Also, every kilogram of H2 can avoid 11.09 kg CO2 from entering the atmosphere. In a 1% market share scenario, proposed hydrogen network avoids more than 37,000 tonnes CO2 per year. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Concerting renewable energy into hydrogen and transporting it to the end of consumption is the promising choice to achieve large-scale deep decarbonization in transportation sector. Based on this, this paper constructs a large-scale centralized renewable energy hydrogen supply chain (HSC) network model to investigate the lowest cost of three different green hydrogen supply pathways, including production, compression, storage, transportation, and utilization. The fluctuation of wind power, solar power, and hydrogen fuel demand are integrated in the model, which is optimized by dynamic programming. Different production and delivery pathways are evaluated to find the least-cost way for transport hydrogen utilization. Applying the model to China’s Western Inner Mongolia (WIM) region, the HSC network plan in 2030 was established. The results show that the least-cost hydrogen supply is to produce hydrogen by wind power and to transport it in liquid hydrogen by truck. This study provides guidance and reference for the future planning and design of green HSC network in other countries or regions. © 2021 ICAE.},

	abstract = {International shipping faces strong challenges with new legally binding air quality regulations and a 50% decarbonisation target by 2050. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a widely used alternative to liquid fossil fuels, but methane emissions reduce its overall climate benefit. This study utilises new emissions measurements and supply-chain data to conduct a comprehensive environmental life cycle and cost assessment of LNG as a shipping fuel, compared to heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine diesel oil (MDO), methanol and prospective renewable fuels (hydrogen, ammonia, biogas and biomethanol). LNG gives improved air quality impacts, reduced fuel costs and moderate climate benefits compared to liquid fossil fuels, but with large variation across different LNG engine types. Methane slip from some engines is unacceptably high, whereas the best performing LNG engine offers up to 28% reduction in global warming potential when combined with the best-case LNG supply chain. Total methane emissions must be reduced to 0.8–1.6% to ensure climate benefit is realised across all timescales compared to current liquid fuels. However, it is no longer acceptable to merely match incumbent fuels; progress must be made towards decarbonisation targets. With methane emissions reduced to 0.5% of throughput, energy efficiency must increase 35% to meet a 50% decarbonisation target. © 2021},

We consider hydrogen production based on several feedstocks and energy sources, namely water with electricity, natural gas and biomass. When using natural gas, we couple hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage. The design of the hydrogen, biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) infrastructure is performed by solving an optimization problem that determines the optimal selection, size and location of the hydrogen production technologies, and the optimal structure of the hydrogen, biomass and CO2 networks. First, we investigate the rationale behind the optimal design of low-carbon hydrogen supply chains by referring to an idealized system configuration and by performing a parametric analysis of the most relevant design parameters of the supply chains, such as biomass availability. This allows drawing general conclusions, independent of any specific geographic features, about the minimum-cost and minimum-emissions system designs and network structures. Moreover, we analyze the Swiss case study to derive specific guidelines concerning the design of hydrogen supply chains deploying carbon capture and storage. We assess the impact of relevant design parameters, such as location of CO2 storage facilities, techno-economic features of CO2 capture technologies, and network losses, on the optimal supply chain design and on the competition between the hydrogen and CO2 networks. Findings highlight the fundamental role of biomass (when available) and of carbon capture and storage for decarbonizing hydrogen supply chains while transitioning to a wider deployment of renewable energy sources. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is becoming an increasingly appealing energy carrier, as the costs of renewable energy generation and water electrolysis continue to decline. Developing scalable modeling and decision tools for the H2 supply chain that fully capture the flexibility of various resources is essential to understanding the overall cost-competitiveness of H2 use. Here, we develop a H2 supply chain planning model that determines the least-cost mix of H2 generation, storage, transmission, and compression facilities to meet H2 demands and is coupled with power systems through electricity prices. We incorporate flexible scheduling for H2 trucks and pipeline, allowing them to serve as both H2 transmission and storage resources to shift H2 demand/production across space and time. The proposed model provides a reasonable trade-off between modeling accuracy and computational time, with linear relaxations for truck inventory routing and H2 production unit commitment. The case study results in the U.S. Northeast indicate that the proposed flexible scheduling of H2 transmission and storage resources is critical not only to cost minimization but also to the choice of H2 production pathways between electrolysis and natural gas based production. Trucks as mobile storage could make intermittent electrolytic H2 production more competitive by providing extra spatiotemporal flexibility.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen and fuel cell technologies are one solution for addressing the challenges that major airports are facing today, such as upward price trends of liquid hydrocarbon fuels, greenhouse gas emission regulations, and stricter noise and air pollutant emission regulations, especially for on-ground pollution. An airport can also be viewed as the center of a hydrogen ecosystem, around which multiple hydrogen users could be clustered, with cost sharing of hydrogen production and storage occurring among users. The main novelty of the present work is the design of a hydrogen infrastructure irrigated by the airport ecosystem that satisfies the airport ecosystem energy needs. For this purpose, the model development is based on a multiobjective optimization framework designed to consider four echelons: energy sources, hydrogen production, transportation, and storage. The multiperiod problem is then solved using the ϵ-constraint method. Two objective functions are involved, that is, the total daily cost (TDC) of the network and an environmental indicator based on the global warming potential. The second innovative contribution is to model the demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for a hydrogen supply chain design. Because hydrogen demand is one the most significant parameters, the uncertainty of the demand has been considered using a proposed fuzzy linear programming strategy. The solutions are compared with the original crisp model, giving more robustness to the proposed approach. This work has been performed in the framework of the Hyport meta-project and, in particular, within the "H2 modeling" project. This paper focuses on a hydrogen airport ecosystem located in the department of Hautes-Pyrénées (France). However, the developed methodology could be extended to other hydrogen ecosystems for which deployment involves a multiperiod multi-objective formulation under an uncertain demand. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {This paper presents techno-economic modelling results of a nationwide hydrogen fuel supply chain (HFSC) that includes renewable hydrogen production, transportation, and dispensing systems for fuel cell electric buses (FCEBs) in Ireland. Hydrogen is generated by electrolysers located at each existing Irish wind farm using curtailed or available wind electricity. Additional electricity is supplied by on-site photovoltaic (PV) arrays and stored using lithium-ion batteries. At each wind farm, sizing of the electrolyser, PV array and battery is optimised system design to obtain the minimum levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH). Results show the average electrolyser capacity factor is 64% after the integration of wind farm-based electrolysers with PV arrays and batteries. A location-allocation algorithm in a geographic information system (GIS) environment optimises the distributed hydrogen supply chain from each wind farm to a hypothetical hydrogen refuelling station in the nearest city. Results show that hydrogen produced, transported, and dispensed using this system can meet the entire current bus fuel demand for all the studied cities, at a potential LCOH of 5–10 €/kg by using available wind electricity. At this LCOH, the future operational cost of FCEBs in Belfast, Cork and Dublin can be competitive with public buses fuelled by diesel, especially under carbon taxes more reflective of the environmental impact of fossil fuels. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Numerous adsorption-based technologies are emerging as candidates for hydrogen transportation, and yet little is known about their practical viability. As such, new approaches are needed to conduct early validation of emerging hydrogen transportation concepts despite a lack of clear criteria for viable future hydrogen supply chains. In this work, we conduct technoeconomic modeling to quantify cost, performance, and relations between system components for early-stage adsorbent-based hydrogen supply chains. We compare results with the cost and performance of high pressure compressed gas and liquid hydrogen trucks in the same applications. Using available experimental adsorption data, we simulate the gravimetric performance of tube trailer trucks packed with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) operated at 100 bar and 77 or 200 K. We also extrapolated available experimental data to study a third scenario where tube trailer trucks are operated at ambient temperature and 250 bar. Models developed for these conditions represent feasible operation scenarios where pressurization or cooling costs can be reduced relative to compressed or liquid hydrogen truck systems. Results suggest that the levelized cost of long-distance transmission, including a gas terminal and MOF-based truck fleet, ranges from $7.3 to $29.0 per kg H2. The levelized cost of transmission using compressed hydrogen gas trucks at 350 and 500 bar and liquid hydrogen trucks is substantially lower, at $1.8, $1.7 and $3.1 per kg H2, respectively. In a short-distance urban distribution application, the MOF-based truck fleet, gas terminal, and refueling stations have a levelized cost between $11.8 and $40.0 per kg H2, which is also more expensive than distribution in the case of the 350 bar, 500 bar and liquid hydrogen trucks, which have levelized costs of $4.7, $4.1 and $3.9 per kg H2, respectively. Key opportunities identified for lowering costs are: increasing the hydrogen capacity of the tube system by developing new MOFs with higher volumetric deliverable capacities, flexible allowable daily deliveries per refueling station, increasing the cycling stability of the MOF, and driverless trucks.  © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The French strategy on hydrogen deployment shows good perspectives at 2050, yet at short term, the economics of clean hydrogen remains ambiguous, and locally inhibits investments. This study evaluates wind-hydrogen project applications at different milestones, following a roadmap of hydrogen industry maturity built over the entire supply chain. Simple linear interpolations are assumed to draw the path of deployment and pave the way for the H2 ecosystem. Hydrogen is here obtained from a dedicated far-offshore wind farm and targets primarily the use in transportation, following policy agenda priorities of maritime transport which could also trigger the H2 demand in industry, gas and power sector. By means of an optimization algorithm, the operation of hybrid wind-hydrogen is simulated to set the size of the necessary infrastructure, under the constraint of H2 delivery timeline (daily or weekly). For instance, the harbor of Saint-Nazaire will distribute at least 4 t H2 per day in 2050 for maritime and road transport, needing the installation of 60 MW of wind energy capacity. Residually it could supply 1,880 t H2 for industry and energy sector, yet, the sectors' coupling hinders business ecosystem building that remains essential to economies of scale and industry establishment. These orders of magnitudes are crucial for the hydrogen industry planning and highly needed by policy makers to set commitments and build regional hydrogen roadmaps for next decades. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Biomass can be converted into a range of different end-products; and when combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS), these processes can provide negative CO2 emissions. Biomass conversion technologies differ in terms of costs, system efficiency and system value, e.g. services provided, market demand and product price. The aim of this study is to comparatively assess a combination of BECCS pathways to identify the applications which offer the most valuable outcome, i.e. maximum CO2 removal at minimum cost, ensuring that resources of sustainable biomass are utilised efficiently. Three bioenergy conversion pathways are evaluated in this study: (i) pulverised biomass-fired power plants which generate electricity (BECCS), (ii) biomass-fuelled combined heat and power plants (BE-CHP-CCS) which provide both heat and electricity, and (iii) biomass-derived hydrogen production with CCS (BHCCS). The design and optimisation of the BECCS supply chain network is evaluated using the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technology framework for the UK (MONET-UK), which integrates biogeophysical constraints and a wide range of biomass feedstocks. The results show that indigenous sources of biomass in the UK can remove up to 56 MtCO/yr from the atmosphere without the need to import biomass. Regardless of the pathway, Bio-CCS deployment could materially contribute towards meeting a national CO2 removal target and provide a substantial contribution to a national-scale energy system. Finally, it was more cost-effective to deploy all three technologies (BECCS, BE-CHP-CCS and BHCCS) in combination rather than individually. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The UK was the first major industrialised nation to commit to a Net Zero target by 2050, and Scotland has an even more ambitious target to reach Net Zero by 2045. To realise these targets, hydrogen will play a leading role in the decarbonisation of multiple sectors including industry, transport, heat and power. Offshore wind can be a core component of our future energy infrastructure, and the scale of its potential role in hydrogen production has recently drawn wider attention from policy makers, developers and potential users across a range of sectors. Hydrogen as a route to market for offshore wind therefore presents a transformative opportunity for the North Sea oil and gas sector and the associated UK supply chain. Existing skills and infrastructure in this region can be leveraged to achieve a leading position in this emerging clean fuel source. This opportunity is particularly relevant for sites in the North Sea which are further from shore with good wind resource, where power transmission costs and/or losses would be prohibitive. Additionally, hydrogen offers an interesting route to market for projects unable to obtain firm grid connection, for sites in regions with high grid charges, or where sufficient government revenue support for conventional power generation is not available for all good quality sites. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen for mobility represents an alternative to conventional fuel to decarbonize the transportation sector. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic properties make the transport and the storage of this energy carrier at standard conditions inefficient. Therefore, this study deploys a georeferenced optimal transport infrastructure for four base case scenarios in France and Germany that differs by production distribution based on wind power potential and demand capacities for the mobility sector at different penetration shares for 2030 and 2050. The restrained transport network to the road infrastructure allows focusing on the optimum combination of trucks operating at different states of aggregations and storage technologies and its impact on the annual cost and hydrogen flow using linear programming. Furthermore, four other scenarios with production cost investigate the impact of upstream supply chain cost, and eight scenarios with daily transport and storage optimization analyse the modeling method sensitivity. The results show that compressed hydrogen gas at a high presser level around 500 bar was, on average, a better option. However, at an early stage of hydrogen fuel penetration, substituting compressed gas at low to medium pressure levels by liquid organic hydrogen carrier minimizes the transport and storage costs. Finally, in France, hydrogen production matches population distribution, in contrast to Germany, which suffers from supply and demand disparity. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to capture the time evolution aspect of the infrastructure deployment needs, three demand scenarios are investigated, going from 1% of market penetration up to 15%. Additionally, two scenarios are taken into account when it comes to the location of the hydrogen production sites vis-à-vis the demand centres.

	abstract = {The identification of site location is one of the critical tasks in developing or expanding any supply chain system including the construction of renewable power generation plants. The accurate identification of a plant site can considerably reduce unforeseen risks and costs and also raise productivity and efficacy. As such, this study sought to thoroughly evaluate all capital cities of a developing country for the establishment of a hybrid wind/solar power plant to produce hydrogen while considering the most influential and conflicting criteria. For this, 14 criteria including daily solar radiation, wind power density, clearness index, altitude, population, average sunny hours in a year, unemployment rate, average air temperature, average air humidity, average yearly precipitation, natural disasters, the distance between the site and the main road, average dusty days per year, and land price constituted the set of vital factors. To prioritize alternatives, a Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making approach named FVIKOR (Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Optimization and Compromise Solution) was used. The results indicated that among 31 capital cities, the city of Yazd with a wind power density of 309.5 W/m2 and daily solar radiation of 5.4 kWh/m2 would be the best location for the purpose of this study. To validate the findings, FTOPSIS (Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was utilized and it also ranked Yazd as the first option. Then, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to discern the behavior of each criterion and their impact on the ranking of the cities. Finally, for hydrogen generation, an autonomous hybrid wind/solar system was techno-economically assessed using HOMER software. According to the analysis outcome, the proposed system showed a payback period of 7 years with levelized cost of 4.75 $/kg for hydrogen. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Converting wind energy into ammonia (WtA) has been recognized as a promising pathway to produce 'green' ammonia compared with traditional coal-based technologies. As the key part of WtA, Power-to-Ammonia (PtA) has great potential to facilitate the usage of wind generation. This paper proposes a co-planning approach for regional wind resources-based ammonia industry and the electric network (EN). To this end, PtA is first modeled as a flexible power load of power systems with spatial and temporal constraints on hydrogen supply chains (HSC). Then a novel co-planning model of WtA and EN is established to optimize the WtA configuration and the EN expansion. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based algorithm is introduced to effectively solve this model. Real data of Inner Mongolia Province in China is adopted to verify the effectiveness and significance of the proposed approach. It is shown that the siting and operation flexibility of PtA with HSC can reduce the expansion burden of EN. The co-planning of WtA and EN can significantly enhance wind power utilization and reduce total investment costs. Furthermore, feasibility analysis on WtA in comparison with coal-to-ammonia (CtA) and ultra-high voltage transmission (UHV) provides helpful guidelines for the realization of WtA.  © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

Hydrogen refueling stations are the middle stage for delivering hydrogen from its sources to consumers, and their location could be affected by the distributed locations of hydrogen sources and consumers. The reasonable siting and sizing of hydrogen refueling stations could both improve the hydrogen infrastructure and reduce regional consumers' cost of using hydrogen. By considering the hydrogen life cycle cost and using a commercial volume forecasting model, this paper creates a relatively thorough and comprehensive model for hydrogen station siting and sizing with the objective of achieving the optimal costs for consumers using hydrogen. The cost-based model includes the selection of the hydrogen sources, transportation methods, and storage methods, and thus, the hydrogen supply chain can also be optimized.

	abstract = {The world is seeking scalable and affordable low carbon and renewable energy sources to reduce atmospheric CO concentration levels while meeting rising global energy demand. Hydrogen is receiving significant attention worldwide as a versatile energy carrier and feedstock that can achieve deep decarbonization across energy and industrial sectors. Researchers have proposed various approaches to evaluate hydrogen supply chains. For example, Almansoori and Shah developed a multi-period hydrogen supply chain model, based on the hydrogen demand of fuelcell vehicles in the Great Britain from 2005 to 2034. Reuß et al. carried out a techno-economic comparison between different transport and storage infrastructure options for scenarios with 25%, 50% and 75% fleet penetration of fuel cellelectrical vehicles in Germany. Seo et al. developed a novel hydrogen supply chain model to compare centralized storage and decentralized storage modes. However, most previous work has focused on country-specific supplychains, such as for the UK, Germany, or South Korea, and considered the transport sector as the only hydrogen demand, neglecting that hydrogen can also be utilized in power and industrial sectors. There is no study on regional hydrogen supply chains with multiple H demand sectors. A regional supply chain can capture the benefits of integrating energy-abundant areas with high energy-consuming areas. In this research, a multi-period regional hydrogen supply chain model is developed for a better understanding of different pathways for a hydrogen economy in Singapore and the ASEAN countries through 2050. A comprehensive superstructure including hydrogen production, storage, delivery, and utilization is proposed. Both renewable and non-renewable hydrogen production technologies with applicable carbon capture and sequestration are included, reflecting the diversity of energy sources available in the region for hydrogen production. To compare different options for an ASEAN hydrogen supply chain through 2050, we carry out techno-economic analyses of hydrogen production taking into account location-dependent attributes, such as cost and carbon emissions. The variation of hydrogen demand over a long-term planning horizon is considered, as well as uncertainty of energy source prices and technological progress, to find the competitive production technologies in each year. Since the volumetric energy density of hydrogen is low, hydrogen must be transported and stored at high pressure or in liquid form, or via liquid organic hydrogen carriers or ammonia. Consequently, different transmission-storage-distribution pathways are also considered and evaluated to address the trade-off between the energy density, energy consumption, and facility cost. Based on the superstructure, a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model is formulated to optimize both the total cost and carbon emissions of the hydrogen supply chain. The most effective pathways for producing, transporting, and storing hydrogen are being identified. Several what-if scenarios are explored to derive insight on relative emissions and costs associated with various hydrogen pathways for the ASEAN region.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is currently receiving significant attention and investment as a key enabler of defossilised global energy systems. Many believe this will eventually result in the international trade of hydrogen as a commodity from countries with significant renewable energy resources, for example New Zealand and Australia, to net energy importing countries including Japan and Korea. Japan has, since 2014, been actively exploring the components of the necessary supply chains, including the assessment of different hydrogen carriers. Public/private partnerships have invested in demonstration projects to assess the comparative merits of liquid hydrogen, ammonia, and organic carriers. On the supply side, significant projects have been proposed in Australia while the impending closure of New Zealand’s Tiwai Point aluminium smelter at the end of 2024 may provide an opportunity for green hydrogen production. However, it is also evident that the transition to a hydrogen economy will take some years and confidence around the timing of supply and demand capacity is essential for new energy infrastructure investment. This paper reviews the expected development of an export market to Japan and concludes that large scale imports are unlikely before the late 2020s. Comparative evaluation of the energy efficiency of various hydrogen carriers concludes that it is too early to call a winner, but that ammonia has key advantages as a fungible commodity today, while liquid hydrogen has the potential to be a more efficient energy carrier. Ultimately it will be the delivered cost of hydrogen that will determine which carriers are used, and while energy efficiency is a key metric, there are other considerations such as infrastructure availability, and capital and operating costs. © 2021 by the author.

Herein, a countrywide supply chain analysis of Germany, spanning until 2050, is applied to investigate promising infrastructure development pathways and associated hydrogen distribution costs for each analyzed hydrogen market. Analyzed supply chain pathways include seasonal storage to balance fluctuating renewable power generation with necessary purification, as well as trailer- and pipeline-based hydrogen delivery. The analysis encompasses green hydrogen feedstock in the chemical industry and fuel cell-based mobility applications, such as local buses, non-electrified regional trains, material handling vehicles, and trucks, as well as passenger cars. Our results indicate that the utilization of low-cost, long-term storage and improved refueling station utilization have the highest impact during the market introduction phase. We find that public transport and captive fleets offer a cost-efficient countrywide renewable hydrogen supply roll-out option. Furthermore, we show that, at comparable effective carbon tax resulting from the current energy tax rates in Germany, hydrogen is cost-competitive in the transportation sector by the year 2025. Moreover, we show that sector-specific CO2 taxes are required to provide a cost-competitive green hydrogen supply in both the transportation and industrial sectors. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is currently considered one of the most promising sustainable energy carriers for mobility applications. A model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on MILP formulation (mixed integer linear programming) in a multi-objective, multi-period formulation, implemented via the ε-constraint method to generate the Pareto front, was conducted in a previous work and applied to the Occitania region of France. Three objective functions have been considered, i.e., the levelized hydrogen cost, the global warming potential, and a safety risk index. However, the size of the problem mainly induced by the number of binary variables often leads to difficulties in problem solution. The first innovative part of this work explores the potential of genetic algorithms (GAs) via a variant of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to manage multi-objective formulation to produce compromise solutions automatically. The values of the objective functions obtained by the GAs in the mono-objective formulation exhibit the same order of magnitude as those obtained with MILP, and the multi-objective GA yields a Pareto front of better quality with well-distributed compromise solutions. The differences observed between the GA and the MILP approaches can be explained by way of managing the constraints and their different logics. The second innovative contribution is the modelling of demand uncertainty using fuzzy concepts for HSC design. The solutions are compared with the original crisp models based on either MILP or GA, giving more robustness to the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The Haber-Bosch process produces ammonia from hydrogen and nitrogen gases in a globally important energy-intensive process that uses coal or natural gas as a fuel and hydrogen source. Direct electrochemical ammonia synthesis from nitrogen and water using renewable energy sources presents an alternative to the Haber-Bosch process that would be more sustainable. Additionally, the different production structure of direct electrochemical nitrogen reduction technology suggests a supply chain alternative to the ammonia industry and a method for load leveling of the electrical grid. This alternative route to ammonia from dinitrogen would require smaller capital investments than the Haber-Bosch process and would not require a fossil fuel supply. The impact of dynamic electrical power pricing is analyzed for a system that could take advantage of pricing volatility. We show that, under certain scenarios, at achievable levels of energy efficiency with a future electrocatalyst, direct nitrogen reduction would be economically competitive or advantageous compared with Haber-Bosch-based ammonia production.

	abstract = {Hydrogen can be produced from the decomposition of methane (also called pyrolysis). Many studies assume that this process emits few greenhouse gas (GHG) because the reaction from methane to hydrogen yields only solid carbon and no CO2. This paper assesses the life-cycle GHG emissions and the levelized costs for hydrogen provision from methane decomposition in three configurations (plasma, molten metal, and thermal gas). The results of these configurations are then compared to electrolysis and steam methane reforming (SMR) with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Under the global natural gas supply chain conditions, hydrogen from methane decomposition still causes significant GHG emissions between 43 and 97 g CO2-eq./MJ. The bandwidth is predominately determined by the energy source providing the process heat, i.e. the lowest emissions are caused by the plasma system using renewable electricity. This configuration shows lower GHG emissions compared to the “classical” SMR (99 g CO2-eq./MJ) but similar emissions to the SMR with CCS (46 g CO2-eq./MJ). However, only electrolysis powered with renewable electricity leads to very low GHG emissions (3 g CO2-eq./MJ). Overall, the natural gas supply is a decisive factor in determining GHG emissions. A natural gas supply with below-global average GHG emissions can lead to lower GHG emissions of all methane decomposition configurations compared to SMR. Methane decomposition systems (1.6 to 2.2 €/kg H2) produce hydrogen at costs substantially higher compared to SMR (1.0 to 1.2 €/kg) but lower than electrolyser (2.5 to 3.0 €/kg). SMR with CCS has the lowest CO2 abatement costs (24 €/t CO2-eq., other > 141 €/t CO2-eq.). Finally, fuels derived from different hydrogen supply options are assessed. Substantially lower GHG emissions, compared to the fossil reference (natural gas and diesel/gasoline), are only possible if hydrogen from electrolysis powered by renewable energy is used (>90% less). The other hydrogen pathways cause only slightly lower or even higher GHG emissions. © 2020},

	abstract = {Time-temperature integrator/indicator (TTI) is a temperature monitoring tool that visually presents the temperature history of foods to easily and cost-effectively manage the temperature of food products in cold chain system. However, few TTIs exhibit suitable performance under chilled conditions over a long period, such as beyond 100 days, as in the storage and distribution of chilled beef across the world. This study aimed to visualize the temperature history of chilled vacuum-packed beef, during international distribution, using Maillard reaction–based TTIs to record the accumulated temperature under chilled conditions, for more than 100 days. The developed Maillard reaction–based TTI comprised of double-sealed large and small plastic pouches. While the small pouch contained 500 μL D-xylose solution, the large pouch contained 1000 μL glycine solution with disodium hydrogen phosphate solution. Both the solutions were mixed by breaking the small pouch into the large pouch, following which the Maillard reaction started, depending on the ambient temperature. We examined two different combinations of the solution concentrations of TTI that turned brown and yellow at − 0.5 °C after approximately 77 days and 100 days, respectively. The developed TTIs, along with Tasmanian chilled beef, were transported from Australia to Japan through commercial supply chains and stored at a constant temperature of − 0.5 °C. One of the TTIs (TTI-brown) turned pale brown after 77 days which is the current shelf life of Australian chilled beef in Japan. The color of TTI-yellow changed to clear yellow after 150 days, when the chilled beef developed an off-odor, as judged by sensory evaluation. The TTI-brown was functional until day 77 which is the current shelf life of Australian beef in Japan, while the TTI-yellow was functional until day 150 to indicate remaining shelf life of beef. The results collectively indicated the Maillard reaction–based TTIs to realize visualization of temperature history during long-term storage and distribution of chilled beef. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

A network optimization model was then developed using a mixed integer linear programming. The optimization model was used to determine the investment timing and allocation to the underlying energy supply system, which includes the type and quantity of utilized renewable sources, in addition to the timing of installation, number and location and of energy facilities installed. The capability of the proposed approach is validated through a case study of future Korea. As a result, we identified the optimal configuration and the investment timing of a complex renewable energy supply system, which was determined by regional resource potentials and cost-effectiveness of the involved technologies.

The proposed model considers the feedstock supply, the installation and operation of hydrogen facilities, the operation of transportation technologies, and the carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. Two primary hydrogen fueling technologies, namely on-site fueling (hydrogen is produced on-site) and standard fueling (hydrogen is delivered by road), are considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that minimizes the least cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The necessity of considering various components within a single framework is demonstrated through a case study in Franche-Comté, France. The role of each key model component (such as the fueling technology, feedstock transportation, and CCS system) is analyzed. The proposed model is capable of studying the interactions that exist between different parts of a hydrogen supply network. Consequently, more comprehensive construction plans for the HSCN are guaranteed. © 2019},

In this paper, we incorporated the electric network (EN) into the HSC for its ability to promptly and economically deliver energy at long distances. The uniform hierarchical time discretization method is utilized to achieve the unified operation of the HSC and the EN. On this basis, an integrated HSC-EN model is elaborated upon to investigate the optimal investment and operation of electrolyzers and storage. Finally, an industrial case in Sichuan province, China is analyzed to illustrate the benefits of incorporating the EN to reduce the investment cost and improve electrolyzers' utilization.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Growing concern about the supply of goods under the COVID pandemic due to border restrictions and community lockdown has made us aware of the limitations of the global supply chain. Fertilizers are pivotal for the growth and welfare of humankind, and there is more than a century of history in industrial technology. Ammonia is the key platform chemical here which can be chemically diversified to all kinds of fertilizers. This article puts a perspective on production technologies that can enable a supply of ammonia locally and on-demand in Australia, for the farmers to produce resilient and self-sustained fertilizers. To assess the validity of such a new business model, multiobjective optimization has to be undergone, and computing is the solution to rank the millions of possible solutions. In this lieu, an economic optimization framework for the Australian ammonia supply chain is presented. The model seeks to address the economic potential of distributed ammonia plants across Australia. Different techniques for hydrogen and related ammonia production such as thermal plasma, nonthermal plasma, and electrolysis (all typifying technology disruption), and mini Haber-Bosch (typifying scale disruption) are benchmarked to the central mega plant on a world-scale using conventional technology, verifying that "Moore's Law"(Mack, C. A. IEEE Trans. 2011, 24 (2), 202-207) of growing bigger and bigger is not the only path to sustainable agriculture. Results show that ammonia can be produced at $317/ton at a regional scale using thermal plasma hydrogen generation which could be competitive to the conventional production model, if credit in terms of lead time and carbon footprint could be taken into account.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {A lot of recent studies have concluded that hydrogen could gradually become a much more significant component of the European energy mix for mobility and stationary fuel cell system applications. Yet, the challenge of developing a future commercial hydrogen economy still remains through the deployment of a viable hydrogen supply chain and an increasing fuel cell vehicle market share, which allows to narrow the existing cost difference regarding the conventional fossil fuel vehicle market. In this paper, the market penetration of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, as substitutes for internal combustion engine vehicles has been evaluated from a social and a subsidy-policy perspective from 2020 to 2050. For this purpose, the best compromise hydrogen supply chain network configuration after the sequential application of an optimization strategy and a multi-criteria decision-making tool has been assessed through a Social Cost-Benefit Analysis (SCBA) to determine whether the hydrogen mobility deployment increases enough the social welfare. The scientific objective of this work is essentially based on the development of a methodological framework to quantify potential societal benefits of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The case study of the Occitania Region in France supports the analysis. The externality costs involve the abatement cost of CO2, noise and local pollution as well as platinum depletion. A subsidy policy scenario has also been implemented. For the case study considered, the results obtained that are not intended to be general, show that CO2 abatement dominates the externalities, platinum is the second largest externality, yet reducing the benefits obtained by the CO2 abatement. The positive externalities from air pollution and noise abatement almost reach to compensate for the negative costs caused by platinum depletion. The externalities have a positive effect from 2025. Using a societal cost accounting framework with externalities and subsidies, hydrogen transition timing is reduced by four years for the example considered. © 2020},

	abstract = {The UK is the first major economy to legislate the reduction of all GHG emissions to net-zero. Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) approaches are likely to be required to support the 2050 net-zero target by offsetting residual emissions from ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is investigated as one technical solution for GGR. This research used process modelling and lifecycle assessment to identify the GGR potential of three BECCS supply chains. Results show that the BECCS supply chains have significant GGR potential with net-negative emissions as CO2e between −647 and −1137 kg MWh−1. Emissions were compared per unit energy output, biomass and area required for each supply chain to assess the GGR potential and BECCS sustainability implications. The large-scale BECCS supply chain features robust technologies with high capacity factor. It produces the greatest electricity generation and annual GGR, however, demands large amounts of biomass raising potential sustainability issues. The medium-scale (CHP) BECCS provides the greatest GGR potential per energy due to its higher energy efficiency. Limitations are a low capacity factor, energy demand-supply balance and non-existent decentralised CCS infrastructure. The (hydrogen) BECCS supply chain is more versatile, producing hydrogen with the potential to support the decarbonisation of not just power, but heat and transport sectors. The GGR potential sits in the middle and has greater benefits from a biomass sustainability perspective, yet, hydrogen infrastructure is not established, and costs remain uncertain. The relative performance of alternative BECCS supply chains should consider direct links between CO2 removal and sustainable biomass and land use, as well as GGR potential. © 2021},

	abstract = {This work introduces an efficient tool for the design of sustainable hydrogen supply chains (HSCs), considering both economic and environmental concerns, through an appropriate multi-objective strategy. The original problem, being formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, takes into consideration the availability of different energy sources, the installation and operation of hydrogen facilities of different sizes and technologies, and the transportation of hydrogen from production units to storage facilities. The area of study is divided into grids which have a specific hydrogen demand that evolves over time, thus a multi-period model of the HSC is considered. In order to overcome the computational burden associated to the solution of large size instances of the resulting problem, we proposed a solution strategy consisting of a hybrid algorithm. The original problem is reformulated into a bi-level optimization problem: the upper level (discrete problem) consists of finding the optimal location for production plants and storage facilities, whereas the lower level (continuous problem) minimizes their corresponding costs associated to transportation and facility operation. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is employed for the solution of the bi-objective upper level, whereas the bi-objective lower level is decomposed using a scalarizing function, which is then solved using a linear programming solver. The proposed methodology is validated through the comparison of the true Pareto fronts given by CPLEX with ε-constraint method, for six increasing size instances. Numerical results prove that the proposed hybrid approach produces an accurate approximation of the Pareto-optimal fronts, more efficiently than the exact solution approach. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen could play a key role in future energy systems by enabling the storage of excess electricity from renewable power sources, like solar and wind, and fueling emission-free fuel cell electric vehicles. Nevertheless, the temporal and spatial gap between the fluctuating production in electrolysis plants and the demand at fueling stations necessitates the construction of infrastructures. Different technologies are available for storing and transporting hydrogen in its gaseous or liquid states, or even via liquid organic hydrogen carriers. To select and compare these different infrastructure options on a nationwide scale in Germany for an energy system 2050, we carried out an infrastructure assessment with spatial resolution to analyze the resulting costs and CO2 emissions, as well as the primary energy demand. To do so, methods for designing a spatially-resolved infrastructure are presented. In particular, the setup of a transmission pipeline with gaseous trailer distribution has not been well represented and investigated in the literature so far. The results show that salt caverns, as well as transmission pipelines, are key technologies for future hydrogen infrastructure systems. The distribution should be handled for low penetration of fuel cell vehicles rates with gaseous compressed trailers and replaced by distribution pipelines in areas with high fueling station densities. This ensures the cost-effective supply during the transition to higher fuel cell vehicle fleets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Green hydrogen can help to decarbonize parts of the transportation sector, but its power sector interactions are not well understood so far. It may contribute to integrating variable renewable energy sources if production is sufficiently flexible in time. Using an open-source co-optimization model of the power sector and four options for supplying hydrogen at German filling stations, we find a trade-off between energy efficiency and temporal flexibility. For lower shares of renewables and hydrogen, more energy-efficient and less flexible small-scale on-site electrolysis is optimal. For higher shares of renewables and/or hydrogen, more flexible but less energy-efficient large-scale hydrogen supply chains gain importance, as they allow to temporally disentangle hydrogen production from demand via storage. Liquid hydrogen emerges as particularly beneficial, followed by liquid organic hydrogen carriers and gaseous hydrogen. Large-scale hydrogen supply chains can deliver substantial power sector benefits, mainly through reduced renewable curtailment. Energy modelers and system planners should consider the distinct flexibility characteristics of hydrogen supply chains in more detail when assessing the role of green hydrogen in future energy transition scenarios. We also propose two alternative cost and emission metrics which could be useful in future analyses. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The mathematical model for carbon capture, utilization and storage supply chains is developed for Italian regions. This model is used to design supply chains minimizing total costs and reducing significantly carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide can be stored or utilized to produce methane through a power to gas system, where hydrogen is obtained by the electrolysis of water using renewable power while methane is fed to the gas grid. The Mixed Integer Linear Program model is applied to design carbon systems developed for ten regions with major carbon dioxide emissions, while different saline aquifers are proposed as storage sites. Results show that the Adriatic sea is the most appropriate offshore storage site in the supply chain. This leads to a lower net methane production cost and to the lowest level of economic incentives as compared to other cases. The total costs of this supply chain are 7.34·104 million €/year (953 €/tonCO2 captured), and 16.1 Mton/year of methane are produced. The supply chain does not result economically favorable without substantial financial incentives (80 €/tonCO2 for carbon tax and 260 €/MWh economic incentive for methane production). Comparing supply chains that include simultaneous utilization and storage of carbon dioxide with a carbon capture and utilization supply chain (without storage) shows that the latter is economically less favorable. In addition to mitigation of carbon environmental impact for the whole Country, the large scale supply chain proposed here meets 35% of Italy's methane demand as a whole, a significant contribution to a global economic perspective, widely discussed nowadays, which should include self-sustainment elements at regional level. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Power-to-gas technologies are considered to be part of the future energy system, but their viability and applicability need to be assessed. Therefore, models for the viability of farm-scale bio-power-to-methane supply chains to produce green gas were analysed in terms of levelised cost of energy, energy efficiency and saving of greenhouse gas emission. In bio-power-to-methane, hydrogen from electrolysis driven by surplus renewable electricity and carbon dioxide from biogas are converted to methane by microbes in an ex situ trickle-bed reactor. Such bio-methanation could replace the current upgrading of biogas to green gas with membrane technology. Four scenarios were compared: a reference scenario without bio-methanation (A), bio-methanation (B), bio-methanation combined with membrane upgrading (C) and the latter with use of renewable energy only (all-green; D). The reference scenario (A) has the lowest costs for green gas production, but the bio-methanation scenarios (B-D) have higher energy efficiencies and environmental benefits. The higher costs of the bio-methanation scenarios are largely due to electrolysis, whereas the environmental benefits are due to the use of renewable electricity. Only the all-green scenario (D) meets the 2026 EU goal of 80% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but it would require a CO2 price of 200 € t−1 to achieve the levelised cost of energy of 65 €ct Nm−3 of the reference scenario. Inclusion of the intermittency of renewable energy in the scenarios substantially increases the costs. Further greening of the bio-methanation supply chain and how intermittency is best taken into account need further investigation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

The analysis is based on field data derived from the 6 MW power-to-gas plant “Energiepark Mainz” and the bus demonstration project “H2-Bus Rhein-Main”. The system is modelled to run simulations on varying demand scenarios. The outcome is minimised hydrogen production costs derived from the optimal scheduling of a power-to-gas plant in terms of the demand.

	abstract = {Although hydrogen is identified to be the first choice of the energy industry in the future society, the severe shortage of hydrogen infrastructure hinders the development of the hydrogen economy. Therefore, by simultaneously integrating the planning and operation issues of a hydrogen supply chain network (HSCN) and taking the hydrogen demand of hydrogen fuel vehicles into account, this paper proposes a general optimization design model for a HSCN based on the off-grid wind-hydrogen coupling system to realize the scientific layout of hydrogen infrastructure and stimulate the transition of hydrogen energy. The uncertainties on both sides of the source and load of a HSCN are well-considered. Therein, the uncertainty of wind power is handled with chance constrained programming, while the uncertainty of hydrogen demand is addressed by a density-based clustering approach. The analysis focuses on a HSCN of Fujian Province, China and case study is conducted. Results show that the estimated hydrogen demand in Fujian Province over the course of a year is 0.197 million tons. The hydrogen production is located in Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Xiamen and the daily hydrogen production in Fuzhou is 309.11 ton/day, accounting for 57.48% of the total hydrogen production in Fujian Province. Since the revenue of the energy storage batteries cannot offset its high investment cost, the abnegation of the energy storage batteries in the HSCN is obtained. Compared with the deterministic HSCN, the total cost of the HSCN considering the uncertainties of wind power and hydrogen demand is reduced by 1.35%. The Levelized cost of hydrogen is 3.073–3.155$/kg and hydrogen production shows a significant scale effect. These results could provide information and direction to stakeholders, investors and policymakers for the planning of the future HSCN in Fujian Province to promote the tremendous development of the hydrogen industry. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in using hydrogen (H2) as a long-duration energy storage resource in a future electric grid dominated by variable renewable energy (VRE) generation. Modeling H2 use exclusively for grid-scale energy storage, often referred to as "power-to-gas-to-power (P2G2P)", overlooks the cost-sharing and CO2 emission benefits from using the deployed H2 assets to decarbonize other end-use sectors where direct electrification is challenging. Here, we develop a generalized framework for co-optimizing infrastructure investments across the electricity and H2 supply chains, accounting for the spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and supply. We apply this sector-coupling framework to the U.S. Northeast under a range of technology cost and carbon price scenarios and find greater value of power-to-H2 (P2G) vs. P2G2P routes. Specifically, P2G provides grid flexibility to support VRE integration without the round-trip efficiency penalty and additional cost incurred by P2G2P routes. This form of sector coupling leads to: (a) VRE generation increase by 13-56%, and (b) total system cost (and levelized costs of energy) reduction by 7-16% under deep decarbonization scenarios. Both effects increase as H2 demand for other end-uses increases, more than doubling for a 97% decarbonization scenario as H2 demand quadruples. We also find that the grid flexibility enabled by sector coupling makes deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for power generation less cost-effective than its use for low-carbon H2 production. These findings highlight the importance of using an integrated energy system framework with multiple energy vectors in planning cost-effective energy system decarbonization. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the development of zero-emissions, sustainable energy systems utilising the potential of hydrogen energy technologies. However, the improper long-term economic assessment of costs and consequences of such hydrogen-based renewable energy systems has hindered the transition to the so-called hydrogen economy in many cases. One of the main reasons for this is the inefficiency of the optimization techniques employed to estimate the whole-life costs of such systems. Owing to the highly nonlinear and non-convex nature of the life-cycle cost optimization problems of sustainable energy systems using hydrogen as an energy carrier, meta-heuristic optimization techniques must be utilised to solve them. To this end, using a specifically developed artificial intelligence-based micro-grid capacity planning method, this paper examines the performances of twenty meta-heuristics in solving the optimal design problems of three conceptualised hydrogen-based micro-grids, as test-case systems. Accordingly, the obtained numeric simulation results using MATLAB indicate that some of the newly introduced meta-heuristics can play a key role in facilitating the successful, cost-effective development and implementation of hydrogen supply chain models. Notably, the moth-flame optimization algorithm is found capable of reducing the life-cycle costs of micro-grids by up to 6.5% as compared to the dragonfly algorithm. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

A multi-period optimization model was developed to design a hydrogen fuel supply chain based on a mixed integer linear programming formulation. The model was applied to the light duty passenger vehicle sector in British Columbia under three hydrogen demand scenarios. As part of the objective function, the model incorporated the current provincial emissions mitigation policies, i.e., a carbon tax and a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS). Based on cost, our model indicates that steam methane reforming (SMR) is the least costly hydrogen production technology even with carbon policies in place. However, SMR would result in higher emissions (compared to other pathways).

	abstract = {Hydrogen can be stored in underground caverns or geological structures in one of four ways. The easiest way to store hydrogen is in salt caverns. These are created by injecting fresh water or water with low salt content into a well down to a salt geological layer, with the extraction of salt-saturated brine. The caverns measure between 50 and 100 metres in diameter and up to several hundred meters tall where the salt formation is thick enough. Salt caverns are not lined, as the salt itself acts as a sealant. This type of storage is suitable for storing hydrogen at extremely high pressures where the salt layer is deep enough. The second way to store large quantities of hydrogen is to inject pure hydrogen or a hydrogen-methane mix into porous rock, in a depleted oil or gas field, or an aquifer. The hydrogen content may vary from a few per cent to 100 per cent. Reservoir and biochemical testing/modelling are to be performed accordingly. The hydrogen-methane mix can be withdrawn and injected into the network. Alternatively, hydrogen can be separated from methane at the well head, for example using pressure swing adsorption technology. Hydrogen can also be stored underground by converting it into a liquid carrier, such as ammonia, which can then be stored in a Lined Rock Cavern. A liner is required to prevent contact between ammonia and water. The pressure and temperature are adapted to optimise the entire supply chain. The advantage of using ammonia is that proper storage conditions can be fulfilled without the need for excessive pressure or temperature. Lastly, hydrogen can be stored underground by directly injecting it into a Lined Rock Cavern. This may take the form of compressed storage (gaseous hydrogen) or cryogenic storage (liquid hydrogen), the choice once again depending on the supply chain as a whole. A liner is required owing to extremely high pressures or extremely low temperatures. It should be noted that storing hydrogen in a Lined Rock Cavern involves a few technical difficulties that have yet to be resolved. These four underground hydrogen storage techniques differ in terms of their technology readiness level (TRL) and cost. All four will likely be required in the coming years to satisfy the needs of a booming market. © Copyright 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

	abstract = {Ongoing research in sustainable battery technologies aims to implement the sodium-ion battery (SIB) as a lower-cost alternative to the lithium-ion battery (LIB), thus reducing the susceptibility of materials to volatility in the supply chain and resource scarcity. However, delving into the design paradigm for a stable cathode host material for efficient SIBs is highly challenging because of the greater radius of sodium ions in comparison to lithium. This study explores the chemical and electrochemical sodium-ion coordination properties of tetrakislawsone (TKL), a tetrameric derivative of the lawsone molecule responsible for the dye properties of henna. TKL exhibits stable capacity in electrolytes with facile and reversible Na-ion coupled redox, allowing it to maintain its performance over hundreds of cycles of charging and discharging. Characterization of the Na-ion coordination mechanism in TKL was performed with solid-state NMR and DFT computations, in conjunction with other spectroscopic methods. It was demonstrated that the chemical binding of Na ions occurs via an eight-membered coordination sphere between hydrogen bonded hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups, forming an interface across two distinct lawsone subunits. This process is accommodated by the three-dimensional structuring of TKL wherein the lawsone units shift out of plane from the aromatic core. This nature-inspired SIB cathode material provides avenues to build fast, stable, high-capacity electrodes using organic molecular systems. © 2019 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {A large-scale hydrogen supply chain is an alternative for the transportation of energy generated from a renewable energy source. Utilizing this technology would drastically improve the generation of clean energy. Therefore, an analysis method to estimate the economic and environmental benefits of the introduction of a hydrogen supply chain using an existing pipeline is developed. The proposed method first estimates the energy and exergy flows in the system to calculate the overall efficiency of these quantities. Afterward, the payback period is estimated based on the overall energy efficiency using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method. The overall efficiency of the system, based on the energy analysis presented, would seem to be the final delivered electrical, fuel and useable heat energy delivered to end use divided by the input solar and wind energy. Furthermore, the environmental effects due to the introduction of the systems are evaluated considering the reduction of global warming and air pollution gases, such as CO2 and PM2.5. The proposed analysis method was applied considering a natural gas pipeline that connects Qinghai and Shanghai. As a result, conversion ratios of 24.9% for electricity and 17.5% for heat were achieved, with the overall efficiency of the system of 42.4% based on the electricity obtained from photovoltaics. 3.02 Gt of CO2, 104 kt of SOx, and 134 kt of NOx, which represent 3.3%, 0.5%, and 0.6% of the annual discharge in China, respectively, and 8.66 kt of PM2.5 would be reduced every year. Furthermore, a reduction of 953 Mt in coal consumption is expected. The payback period of the proposed system using the DCF method is 4.17 and 2.28 years for the two alternatives evaluated in this work. The cash flow of the DCF is influenced by installation cost and operation cost of equipment. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This study follows a deterministic modeling approach to project two scenarios of FCEV adoption and the resulting hydrogen demand (low and high) up to 2050 in California, using a transportation transition model. The study then estimates the number of hydrogen production and refueling facilities required to meet demand. The impact of system scale-up and learning rates on hydrogen price is evaluated using standalone supply chain models: H2A, HDSAM, HRSAM and HDRSAM. A sensitivity analysis explores key factors that affect hydrogen prices. In the high scenario, light and heavy-duty fuel cell vehicle stocks reach 12.5 million and 1 million by 2050, respectively. The resulting annual hydrogen demand is 3.9 billion kg, making hydrogen the dominant transportation fuel. Satisfying such high future demands will require rapid increases in infrastructure investments starting now, but especially after 2030 when there is an exponential increase in the number of production plants and refueling stations. In the long term, electrolytic hydrogen delivered using dedicated hydrogen pipelines to larger stations offers substantial cost savings. Feedstock prices, size of the hydrogen market and station utilization are the prominent parameters that affect hydrogen price. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {CCUS technologies are essential for meeting global temperature targets because of their ability to decarbonize hard to abate sectors and provide negative emissions when paired with bioenergy. In the power sector the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) foresees an average global CCUS build rate of 16 GW/year from 2020 to 2040. However, current deployment rates languish far below this level, as there are currently only two operational power CCUS plants with a combined capacity of 355 MW. Both are retrofitted coal plants, but most future climate models require a diverse CCUS portfolio consisting of coal/gas CCUS plants, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and using CCUS in a hydrogen power generation chain. This study is commissioned by IEAGHG and aims to understand the evolving future roles of different CCUS technologies in various power markets and policy measures which can overcome current barriers to deployment. The UK, USA, People's Republic of China (China) and Australia are selected as model power markets as they represent some of the leading countries in the CCUS space. First, a techno-economic analysis is undertaken which compares the economic feasibility of CCUS options with counterfactual technologies (nuclear, unabated gas/coal, battery storage) under different operational modes (baseload, mid-merit, peaking generation) for each country. Later, a literature review is undertaken to determine policy recommendations which may overcome deployment barriers for post-combustion CCUS, BECCS, power generation through hydrogen, CCUS retrofits and flexible CCUS operations. Finally, the existing CCUS policy support in each of the four countries is reviewed along with region specific recommendations to make CCUS technologies more viable in each country. It is found that globally BECCS, gas CCUS and hydrogen are viable options for baseload, mid-merit and peaking generation, respectively. Hydrogen power generation is the lowest cost low-carbon option for flexible backup generation for sustained periods (>8 hours) of high demand, complimenting batteries which are cheaper for shorter periods. However, peaking hydrogen would require a higher support mechanism in the USA and Australia compared to other regions due to relatively more expensive hydrogen costs. Gas CCUS is likely to be one of the most economic mid-merit and baseload technologies, even in regions without domestic gas resources due to its lower costs than alternatives. BECCS is expected to be a strategic technology for climate targets due to the associated negative emissions, thus it is expected to be deployed in all regions to a certain extent, even if it is not the lowest-cost CCUS option. China is the only region where coal CCUS is competitive with other CCUS technologies at high load factors and hydrogen power is very cost-effective irrespective of operational mode. The two main reasons for this divergent result for China are the low-cost domestic coal availability and the opportunity for cheap hydrogen production through coal gasification with CCS. Economic constraints relating to high upfront capital investment requirement and lack of mechanisms to recover high operational expenses are found to be the two major barriers to CCUS deployment. Capital challenges can be alleviated by tax credits, public procurement, grants, concessional loans, direct equity investment, progressive financing, international financing institutions and export credit agencies. Operational expenses can be addressed through policies such as feed-in-tariffs, contract for differences, emission performance standards, CCUS obligations with tradable CCUS certificates or additional revenues from CO2 utilization. Each country is likely to use some combination of these policies to incentivize capture plants, while the transport & storage part of the supply chain may be handled by dedicated companies that are publicly owned or supported through regulated models. The above measures must be supplemented by specific policies that focus on different CCUS applications. Retrofits would benefit from imposing retrofit readiness criteria to all new plants, while BECCS would require recognition of negative emissions and establishing strong biomass sustainability criteria. Developing appropriate business models for the low-carbon hydrogen supply-chain would be vital for deploying hydrogen power. Lastly, flexible CCUS is extremely understudied for policy purposes and new policies, such as flexible contract for differences, must be developed and tested to encourage peaking plant operation. The four countries studied have varying levels of regulatory and policy support for CCUS, but all must improve their financial incentives through adopting some of the measures proposed above. Regulatory improvements, such as fossil fuel phase-out plans, CCUS readiness requirements and limiting post-closure liabilities of CO2 storage companies are some of the common recommendations for each country. Additionally, each country may improve on their existing schemes, policies and use their existing financial institutions more efficiently to incentivize mass deployment of CCUS technologies at levels consistent with global climate models. © 2021 15th Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies Conference 2021, GHGT 2021.

Furthermore, we also investigate the set covering constraint will ensure that each region is covered by minimum number of the hydrogen facilities. The developed model ensures a balance between location, distribution, storage, production, safety and staff decisions by installing two production facilities by assigning total 9 warehouses, 22 tank trucks, 12100 km pipeline, 35 staffs under distance constraint 2000 km in regions 1 and 5.

	abstract = {Injection of hydrogen into existing natural gas grids, either partially or as a complete conversion, could decarbonise heat and take advantage of the inherent flexibility that gas grids provide in a low-carbon future. However, hydrogen injection is not straightforward due to the differing properties of the gases and the need for low-cost, low-carbon hydrogen supply chains. In this study, an up-to-date assessment of the opportunities and challenges for hydrogen injection is provided. Through value chain optimisation, the outlook for hydrogen injection is considered in the context of a national energy system with a high reliance on natural gas. The optimisation captures the operational details of hydrogen injection and gas grid flexibility, whilst also modelling the wider context, including interactions with the electricity system and delivery of energy from primary resource to end-use. It is found that energy systems are ready for partial hydrogen injection now and that relatively low feed-in tariffs (£20–50/MWh) could incentivise it. Partial hydrogen injection could provide a stepping stone for developing a hydrogen infrastructure but large scale decarbonisation of gas grids requires complete conversion to hydrogen. Whether this solution is preferable to electrification in the long term will depend on the value of the gas grid linepack flexibility and the costs of expanding electricity infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The economic developments around the globe resulted in the increased demand of energy, which overburdened the supply chain sources of energy. Fossil fuel reserves are exploited to meet the high demand of energy and their combustion is becoming the main source of environmental pollution. So there is dire need to find safe, renewable and sustainable energy resources. Waste to energy (WtE) may be viewed as a possible alternate source of energy, which is economically and environmentally sustainable. Municipal solid waste (MSW) is a major contributor to the development of renewable energy and sustainable environment. At present the scarcity of renewable energy resources and disposal of MSW is a challenging problem for the developing countries, which has generated a wide ranging socioeconomic and environmental problems. This situation stimulates the researchers to develop alternatives for converting WtE under a variety of scenarios. Herein, the present scenario in developing the WtE technologies such as, thermal conversion methods (Incineration, Gasification, Pyrolysis, Torrefaction), Plasma technology, Biochemical methods, Chemical and Mechanical methods, Bio-electrochemical process, Mechanical biological treatment (MBT), Photo-biological processes for efficacious energy recovery and the challenges confronted by developing and developed countries. In this review, a framework for the evaluation of WtE technologies has been presented for the ease of researchers working in the field. Furthermore, this review concluded that WtE is a potential renewable energy source that will partially satisfy the demand for energy and ensure an efficient MSW management to overcome the environmental pollution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {21st century energy production, conversion, and delivery systems need to go through a transition to be less carbon-intensive while meeting an increasing energy demand. In a more and more interconnected world, energy systems of various sectors (e.g. power, fuels, chemicals, etc.) go through this transition via shifting the primary energy sources from carbon-intensive fossil-fuels to renewable and sustainable resources. With this study, we present a multi-scale strategy for optimal design and operation of multi-product process systems that can produce power, synthetic fuels, chemicals, and energy carriers from renewable and fossil resources. This multi-scale approach combines process synthesis, scheduling, and supply chain concepts in a mixed-integer linear programming model to address the trade-offs between integrating various fossil and renewable technologies. Our strategy is applied to integration of low-emission (i) synthetic liquid transportation fuels, (ii) hydrogen, (iii) ammonia, (iv) methanol, and (v) renewable power production from natural gas, solar, and wind energy at a location in Amarillo, Texas. Case study results show that with our approach various energy systems can be modeled either separately and integrated with the same common representation. Sectors integration to produce low-emission products in the same facility can result in 17% reduction in total production costs. While solar and wind energy are favorable to produce renewable power, current state-of-the-art methane conversion technologies are more favorable to produce hydrogen and hydrogen-based products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Given that hydrogen injection into existing natural gas pipeline networks is an economical way to utilise this clean gas, this paper explores its benefits by studying its supply chain optimisation and analysing its reliability. First, a mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimise transport and dissatisfaction costs. Material balance, supply and transport of natural gas, operation of pipeline networks, and hydrogen injection are considered as constraints. The operating plans of a regional natural gas supply chain (NGSC), with and without hydrogen injection, are optimised. Then, three types of indicators – economic indices, coal and hydrogen as percentages of total energy consumption, and CO2 emissions – are applied to compare the performance of the NGSC in different situations. A case verifies the proposed model and shows the influence of utilising hydrogen in an NGSC. The optimal operating plans under one standard and two non-standard conditions are calculated, and the reliability of the supply chain is analysed. Results illustrate that injecting hydrogen in the NGSC is beneficial in reducing CO2 emissions and operating costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Three different cases are considered, according to hydrogen production route required to correct the syngas composition: hydrogen by external reforming, hydrogen by external water electrolysis, hydrogen by internal steam reforming. Results show that absorption is the preferred capture solutions at high flue gas flow rate. Results also show that the best option is providing hydrogen by water electrolysis, because a higher amount of carbon dioxide is used to produce the same amount of methanol with lower environmental impact. The proposed network produces 203 Mton/year of methanol, then Germany would be able to satisfy the world methanol demand in the next years.

However, the energy demand of China is increasing with the fast-growing economy and China relies heavily for its electricity on coal, which will make it difficult to achieve carbon neutrality. Therefore, the energy demand and supply planning in the future for China should be optimized. In this work, the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System was used to forecast the end-use energy demand of China. A new mixed-integer linear programming model was developed to optimize the energy structure, infrastructure projects and exploitation schemes under the constraint of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, an economic, feasible and sustainable energy planning was also obtained. Results show that the electrification rate, green hydrogen demand and other energy demand of China will increase substantially. The coal production capacity will be concentrated, the integration of oil production and refining will be gradually realized, and the production of non-fossil power will increase considerably. The total greenhouse gas emissions of the energy consumption in China between 2017 and 2060 will be approximately 262,783 million tons of CO2 equivalents. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is considered a promising green energy carrier due to its long storage period and zero harmful emissions. The green hydrogen produced by water electrolysis using renewable energy is indispensable for expanding the renewable energy grid and establishing a clean energy society. As renewable power sources are widely deployed, hydrogen can be utilized to connect the energy demand section with the energy supply section. To transport hydrogen to demand sites, one of the most common commercial methods is hydrogen compression. Notably, high-pressure water electrolysis does not need to additionally compress hydrogen, which can significantly diminish the cost of hydrogen production. In this study, to evaluate the effect of the operating pressure on the performance of an alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) system, a numerical model of the AWE system was developed using Aspen Plus®. The AWE system is comprised of the AWE stack, water pumps, heat exchangers, separator, condenser, and electric heat pump (EHP) system. The AWE stack model is validated by comparing the current–voltage polarization curve with experimental data. Simulation results show that an appropriate pressure makes the system more efficient due to decreasing the power consumption of the balance of plant (BOP). Furthermore, high-pressure water electrolysis has a large advantage for obtaining high-purity hydrogen (over 99.9%) without using a water adsorption device. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, we present a new model which couples the hydrogen supply chain with the electricity system. We use this model to analyse a case study of Germany in 2030. We find that if efficient spatially resolved electricity tariffs are applied instead of existing uniform tariffs, electrolyzers are placed primarily at low-cost nodes and farther away from consumption centers. For hydrogen, this leads to higher transportation costs, but lower production costs, and lower total costs. Moreover, costs for congestion management decrease substantially. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {There is no doubt that energy will have one of highest priorities in agendas of strategic plans of countries. Since fossil fuels are running out and carbon emissions are more important than ever, researchers seek alternative clean and efficient energy sources. One of the best alternatives is hydrogen. The systems in which hydrogen flows from its production to end users are called hydrogen supply chains (HSC). Since hydrogen is not in active use, its HSC infrastructure is not complete and should be planned very carefully. We study the design of HSC of Turkey to meet the hydrogen demand of the period between 2021 and 2050. Our aim is to minimize total cost of the HSC while meeting the demand of the transportation sector. We address the problem by using a mixed integer programming (MIP) model and derive several insights for the future HSC. The results show that while decentralization (being able to fulfill the demand from local production facilities) is 12% in the first period, this rate raises up to 48% by the end of the planning horizon. Analysis also reveal that almost all grids do not produce and import hydrogen simultaneously, i.e., they either produce or import hydrogen. The results are robust in the sense that solutions of different optimality gaps have minor differences in terms of established facilities. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

This study proposes a two-stage spatiallyexplicit hydrogen supply chain optimisation framework that integrates the Geographical Information System and mathematical optimisation model. The first stage involves spatial analysis to identify potential production site and demand site locations based on the geographical factors. Transportation distance between the potential production sites and the demand sites will be computed and input to the mathematical optimisation model. In the second stage, the mathematical model is solved to identify the cost-optimal production site location. The proposed methodology is applied to Malaysia case study and the optimal site location has been identified. The annual cost of the optimised hydrogen supply chain is determined to be 159.3 million USD.  © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.},

	abstract = {A novel approach for sustainability enhancement of jet biofuel production from palm oil and soybean oil is proposed. A comparative Well-to-Wake analysis was performed assuming a supply chain in two strategic regions of Brazil, according to each raw material. The functional unit was 1.0 MJ of energy, and impacts were quantified using Impact 2002 + and Cumulative Energy Demand methods. Two different situations, referred to as scenarios, for each vegetable oil were proposed. First conversion scenario (baseline case) included conventional jet biofuel production characteristics, regarding the use of fossil hydrogen. Second conversion scenario (enhanced case) explored renewable alternatives for hydrogen production, such as residual biomass gasification, in palm oil case, and water electrolysis, for soybean oil scenario. Results indicate significant reductions, ranging from 57% to 94%, in the global warming impact category of all scenarios as compared with conventional jet fuel. Moreover, palm oil and soybean oil improved scenarios reached the lowest carbon footprint of 4.8 and 33.9 g CO2 eq/MJ, respectively. Additionally, when considering Life Cycle Energy Efficiency an increase of about 65% and 63% for palm oil and soybean oil enhanced scenarios was observed, compared to baseline cases. In the case of Fossil Energy Ratio, an increase of 4.4% and 29.6% was determined in the same vein. Besides, in all scenarios, palm oil showed lower consumption of fossil and renewable energy than soybean oil. Some limitations of the present work can be described as: economic and logistic feasibility, due to immature technologies; geographic conditions which could affect agricultural performance; and technical aspects regarding hydrogen production technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

An improved RES was created to illustrate the current energy network of Burdur city and to determine the relationships between energy carriers and the respective technologies, and then this structure is specified by the relevant data, including fuel cell-powered land vehicle technologies integrated into the land transportation demand side. This paper analyses the feasibility of hydrogen as an alternative energy carrier in the fuel mix for electricity generation in Burdur City to achieve sustainable economic growth, to improve the energy security by minimizing respective environmental emissions and indicate the possible implications of the introduction of the hydrogen supply chain and respective fuel cell end-use technologies in a city level energy modelling perspective. Burdur is selected as the target city to implement the designated level of land transport passenger demand by hydrogen technologies; and after implementation of hydrogen cars in 2020; it has been evaluated that only 0.09 PJ of hydrogen car activity prevents a total of 43.44 kT CO2 emission in Burdur, addressing the 8% of the total emission in the base scenario between the analysis time horizon.

	abstract = {Bladder carcinoma is the most expensive tumor type to treat on a cost-per-patient basis from diagnosis to death. Treatment with Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) instillation is the only approved immunotherapy in the clinic for the remission of superficial bladder carcinoma. Unfortunately, frequent relapses, high local morbidity, risk of systemic mycobacterial infection, and occasional supply chain interruptions limit the utility of BCG for bladder cancer treatment. It is well known that BCG utilizes an adhesin protein known as fibronectin attachment protein that possesses a crucial RWFV peptide sequence for binding to the bladder tumor microenvironment prior to the initiation of the immunotherapeutic response. We report a RWFV-targeted, pH-responsive stabilized lipid nucleic acid nanoparticle (LNP) vehicle for the effective delivery of an immunotherapeutic oligonucleotide, CpG, that is assembled using a glass microfluidic Chemtrix 3221 reactor. Our small-angle X-ray scattering studies revealed a layer-by-layer assembly of the oligonucleotides with a repeat distance of 6.04 nm within the LNP. Using flow cytometry to evaluate the different cell types found in the bladder tumor microenvironment, RWFV-targeted LNPs were found to attach specifically to fibronectin-secreting cells in culture during a 2 h incubation period. The trafficking and cellular fate of these targeted LNPs were revealed by confocal microscopy of RAW264.7 macrophages to enter the endocytotic pathway within 4 h post treatment. Importantly, control studies reveal that only the pH-sensitive LNP formulation is capable of efficiently releasing the payload within 12 h. As a result, the targeted pH-sensitive LNP resulted in higher expression levels of costimulatory molecules CD83, CD 86, and MHC II, while also inducing higher levels of TNF-α secretion from macrophages. These results demonstrate that RWFV-targeted, pH-sensitive LNP formulations are capable of maximum immunotherapeutic response, potentially making them a highly efficient, lower risk, and readily manufactured alternative to BCG immunotherapy. © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

Robust decisions on the provision of infrastructure requires integrated models to perform analytics across the entire energy supply chain. A national level combined gas and electricity transmission network model was upgraded to represent local energy systems. Multiple energy vectors including electricity, gas, hydrogen and heat were integrated within the modelling framework. The model was utilised for a study of the Oxford-Cambridge arc region. The study assessed how different energy supply strategies, from electrification of heat to use of ‘green’ gases or local heat networks, could affordably reduce carbon emissions from the Oxford-Cambridge arc region energy system whilst considering constraints from the national system. The modelling process generated a diverse range of options for energy supplies, the choice of supply networks and end use technologies. The analysis illustrated the cost effectiveness and emission reduction potential of electrification of heat despite the requirement for additional network and supply capacity. Additionally, insulation and other energy efficiency solutions were also analysed. Potential barriers to technological change such as upfront costs, lack of awareness and perceived technology shortcomings were discussed in the context of the strategies assessed. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {This work presents a methodological design framework for Hydrogen and Methane Supply Chains (HMSC). An innovative approach is to focus on Power-to-Hydrogen (PtH) and Power-to-Methane (PtM) concepts, and their interactions with other technologies, and energy carriers (i.e., Steam Methane Reforming – SMR, and natural gas). The overall objective of this work is to perform single objective and multi-objective optimizations for HMSC design to provide effective support for deployment scenarios. The methodological framework developed is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach with augmented ε-constraint implemented in the GAMS environment according to a multi-period approach (2035-2050). Several available energy sources (wind, PV, hydro, national power grid, and natural gas) for hydrogen production through electrolysis and SMR are included. Carbon dioxide sources stem mainly from methanization and gasification processes, which are used to produce methane through methanation. The objective to be minimised in the single optimization approach is the total annual cost considering the externality of greenhouse gas emissions through the carbon price for the whole HMSC over the entire period studied. The multi-objective optimization includes as objectives the total annual cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and the total methane production from methanation. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), and the greenhouse gas emissions for each energy carrier are also computed. The results show that renewable hydrogen from PtG can be competitive with SMR through the implementation of carbon prices below 0.27 €/kgCO2. In the case of synthetic methane, the available resources can meet the demand through PtG, and even if synthetic methane for natural gas network injection is thus far from competitive with natural gas, power-to-gas technologies have the potential to decarbonize the fossil economy and achieve a circular economy through CO2 recovery. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This article addresses transnational ‘retrofit’ brown coal hydrogen generation energy systems. Retrofit energy supply-chains, from generation to end product, encompass fossil fuel energy generation with retrofitted carbon capture and storage (CCS), for clean energy [hydrogen] output. Three research questions are posited: can an energy security framework be identified for analysis of fossil fuel retrofit hydrogen exports; what findings arise from applying the framework to a case study of Australian exports of coal-generated hydrogen to Japan; and are such international energy systems compromised by sub-optimal carbon-emitting supply chains, with potential implications for global energy justice? A systematic literature review identified a modified framework, further developed in this article to catalyse global energy security-justice analysis; contributing a useful energy security-justice tool. Applying the framework, findings illustrate key opportunities in Australia/Japan's energy diversification, supply security, and bilateral trade-strategic security relationships. Key risks include emissions and economic costs, risks in the production process, shipping complexities, and doubts concerning CCS. Interests of conservative politics and pro-coal/CCS influencers dominate how security is framed, deprioritising energy justice concerns and privileging coal interests and mining jobs over potentially more resilient renewable energy pathways and jobs. The research has implications for future research, policy development and energy system planning. © 2021},

However, there are large capacity differences for each country's hydrogen production, making hydrogen trading necessary. Although extensive research has investigated hydrogen technologies and economics, to the best of our knowledge, no study has examined the optimization of the overall hydrogen supply chain, from overseas supply to domestic consumption, considering various feasibility scenarios. This is a case study on the hydrogen supply chain for South Korea, which is expected to be one of the major hydrogen-importing countries, considering the decarbonized hydrogen requirements of the importing country and the production capacities of exporting countries over two decades. This study's optimized results for a hydrogen supply chain via mixed-integer linear programming reveal that it is most feasible for South Korea to import blue hydrogen from Qatar and Russia and green hydrogen from UAE and India, using liquefied hydrogen in the near term. This is because of the significantly lesser resource prices compared to other countries. The share of blue hydrogen supply dominates in the near term, while the green hydrogen supply is expected to gradually prevail over blue hydrogen due to an exponential drop in the renewable electricity price. With the price drop of green hydrogen, green hydrogen purchases from other countries in tandem with the UAE are predicted, rather than the blue hydrogen supply, considering that long-term demand will exceed the UAE's predicted capacity.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.},

The economic values for all applicable chemical commodities are quantified (syngas, ammonia, methanol and oxygen) and an hourly electricity model is constructed to mimic the dispatch of key technologies: bi-directional power plants, dual-fuel heating systems and plug-in fuel-cell hybrid electric vehicles. The operation of key technologies determines hourly electricity prices and an optimization model adjusts the capacity to minimize electricity prices yet allow all generators to recover costs. We examine 12 cost scenarios for renewables, nuclear and natural gas; the results demonstrate emissions-free, 'energy-only' electricity markets whose supply is largely dominated by renewables. The economic outcome is made possible in part by seizing the full supply-chain value from electrolysis (both hydrogen and oxygen), which allows an increased willingness to pay for (renewable) electricity. The wholesale electricity prices average $25-$45/ MWh, or just slightly higher than the assumed levelized cost of renewable energy. This implies very competitive electricity prices, particularly given the lack of need for 'scarcity' pricing, capacity markets, dedicated electricity storage or underutilized electric transmission and distribution capacity. © The Author(s) 2020.

Therefore, in this paper, a comparative assessment between the total (cT ) and non-renewable (cNR) unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions (cCO2) of the electricity, methane and hydrogen produced from sugarcane vinasse and bagasse is presented and compared with the conventional (fossil fuel-based) supply chains. As a result, the non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions for the transportation service in all cases analysed are 3.1 to 4.7 times lower compared with conventional fossil fuels (e.g., diesel, gasoline, natural gas and hydrogen). Among the waste upgrade alternatives, methane production is able to maximise the exergy flow rate of products in the transformation stage (52.4-58.6 MW), while hydrogen and electricity production can substantially increase the transportation service in the end-use stage (51.7-52.1%) and the operational revenues (2,706-2,889 EUR/h).

	abstract = {Carbon-free transportation is envisaged by means of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV) pro-pelled by hydrogen that originates from renewably electricity. However, there is a spatial and tem-poral gap in the production and demand of hydrogen. Therefore, hydrogen storage and transport remain key challenges for sustainable transportation with FCEVs. In this study, we propose a method for calculating a spatially resolved highway routing model for Germany to transport hydrogen by truck from the 15 production locations (source) to the 9683 fueling stations (sink) required by 2050. We consider herein three different storage modes, namely compressed gaseous hydrogen (CGH2), liquid hydrogen (LH2) and liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHC). The model applies Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm for all available source-sink connections prior to optimizing the supply. By creating a detailed routing result for each source-sink connection, a detour factor is in-troduced for “first and last mile” transportation. The average detour factor of 1.32 is shown to be necessary for the German highway grid. Thereafter, the related costs, transportation time and trav-elled distances are calculated and compared for the examined storage modes. The overall transportation cost result for compressed gaseous hydrogen is 2.69 €/kgH2, 0.73 €/kgH2 for liquid hydrogen, and 0.99 €/kgH2 for LOHCs. While liquid hydrogen appears to be the most cost-efficient mode, with the integration of the supply chain costs, compressed gaseous hydrogen is more convenient for minimal source-sink distances, while liquid hydrogen would be suitable for distances greater than 130 km. © 2021 by the authors.

Advocates support electrolytic (green) hydrogen or (blue) hydrogen that relies on methane reformation with carbon capture and storage; however, efforts to definitively choose how to deliver this scaling up are premature. For blue hydrogen, methane emissions must be minimized. Best in class supply chain management in combination with high rates of CO2 capture can deliver a low carbon hydrogen product. In the case of electrolytic hydrogen, the carbon intensity of power needs to be very low for this to be a viable alternative to blue hydrogen. Until the electricity grid is deeply decarbonized, there is an opportunity cost associated with using renewable energy to produce hydrogen, as opposed to integrating this with the power system. To have a realistic chance of success, net zero transition pathways need to be formulated in a way that is coherent with socio-political-economic constraints. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The infrastructure and energy requirements of four options for transporting hydrogen between export and import terminals, namely methyl cyclohexane, liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen, and liquid ammonia, are analyzed in detail. These are compared for HSC energy penalty, carbon avoidance and landed cost of hydrogen under different scenarios. A case study is also presented to capture the perspectives of an importer.

	abstract = {This study involves the construction of a hydrogen supply chain optimization model using a centralized storage model that combines and consolidates flows of hydrogen from different production sites into integrated bulk storage. To supply hydrogen to a fuel cell electric vehicle station, various hydrogen supply pathways and storage configurations for different types of production technologies and transportation modes are considered. In terms of the topological structure, the centralized storage model requires fewer storage areas than the decentralized storage model. The results show that a hydrogen supply chain with a centralized storage structure advances the phase transition of central hydrogen production plants and reduces the total annual cost of the entire supply chain. The optimal hydrogen pathway is on-site steam methane reforming production in the early markets for fuel-cell electric vehicles. However, in matured markets, hydrogen is liquefied in central production plants and stored in bulk storages equipped with vaporizers. Then, the hydrogen is distributed from the central storage areas to local refueling stations via pipelines. The role of central storage areas is predicted to become important as market shares of fuel cell electric vehicle reach 15–30%; in other words, 0.28–0.56 million tonne/year of hydrogen will be demanded in 20 cities of South Korea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Green ammonia production as an important application for propelling the upcoming hydrogen economy has not been paid much attention by China, the world's largest ammonia producer. As a result, related studies are limited. This paper explores potential supply chain design and planning strategies of green ammonia production in the next decade of China with a case study in Inner Mongolia. A hybrid optimization-based simulation approach is applied, considering traditional optimization approaches are insufficient to address uncertainties and dynamics in a long-term energy transition. Results show that the production cost of green ammonia will be at least twice that of the current level due to higher costs of hydrogen supply. Production accounts for the largest share of the total expense of green hydrogen (~80 %). The decline of electricity and electrolyser prices are key in driving down the overall costs. In addition, by-product oxygen is also considered in the model to assess its economic benefits. We found that by-product oxygen sales could partly reduce the total expense of green hydrogen (~12 % at a price of USD 85/t), but it also should be noted that the volatile price of oxygen may pose uncertainties and risks to the effectiveness of the offset. Since the case study may represent the favourable conditions in China due to the abundant renewable energy resources and large-scale ammonia industry in this region, we propose to take a moderate step towards green ammonia production, and policies should be focused on reducing the electricity price and capital investments in green hydrogen production. We assume the findings and implications are informative to planning future green ammonia production in China. © 2021 The Author(s)},

A practical selecting procedure of adding hydrogen refueling service to existing natural gas (NG) stations is proposed in this study.

The demand for hydrogen fuel and initial supply chain of hydrogen in Wuhan are estimated based on the deployment objective of fuel cell buses. The existing NG stations are evaluated based on 300 kg/day to determine whether they meet the hydrogen safety requirement using Google map or field investigation. The safety space requirement of the hydrogen refueling area on existing NG station is determined as 25.9 × 27.1 m2. The optimal hydrogen refueling plan for fuel cell buses is calculated with multi-objective analysis in economic, environmental, and safety aspects from the view of the hydrogen refueling supply chain. It is shown that adding hydrogen refueling stations to existing NG stations is feasible in technology, economics, regulation, and operation considerations.

In particular, the life cycle NH3 supply chain for H2 production is considered including production, transportation, and decomposition back to H2. Based on the classification of NH3 into three different types depending on how the chemical is produced, NH3 price and CO2 emissions are evaluated. In addition, using a commercial process simulator, the decomposition process is modeled and techno-economic analysis for the whole process for H2 production reveals that NH3 price is the most influential economic factor and the H2 production cost can compete with renewable-based H2 but it is still higher than fossil fuel-based H2 production. Moreover, H2 supply via NH3 decomposition is projected based on a domestic implementation plan in the Republic of Korea resulting in estimation of NH3 price, H2 production cost, and corresponding CO2 emissions in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The objective is to minimize the sum of investment, expansion, production, and distribution costs while satisfying the demand in each period. Hydrogen production costs are subject to economies of scale which causes non-linearity in the objective function. We model long-term investment and expansion costs separately from short-term production costs. The short-term production costs depend on the installed capacity and production quantities. We analyze two models that differ in investment decision flexibility and two demand scenarios: demand only from the maritime sector and demand from the whole transportation sector in Norway. The results show that the scenario with higher demand does not lead to a higher number of built facilities due to the economies of scale. The model with higher flexibility leads to higher capacity utilization in the first periods and thus significantly lower production costs. The results further indicate that the initial demand is too low to build a steam methane reforming facility, instead only electrolysis facilities are built in both scenarios and both models. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Route Ⅰ and II are onsite hydrogen supply routes powered by a stand-alone or grid-connected photovoltaic (PV)-wind generation system separately. Route Ⅲ and IV are offsite hydrogen supply routes, in which hydrogen is produced by a stand-alone or grid-connected PV-wind generation system located in Qinghai Province respectively and delivered via liquid hydrogen truck to Shanghai. The microgrid system for hydrogen production is designed and optimized with the aid of HOMER Pro® software. The results show that in hydrogen production stage, Route Ⅳ shows the best economic performance, both in the total net present cost (NPC) cost and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) cost. As for the whole hydrogen supply chain, Route IV is also the most economic hydrogen supply way, the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of which is slightly lower than that of Route II. The sensitivity results show that the total LCOH cost of Route Ⅳ is feasible based on the current shorter electrolyzer's lifetime. Therefore, it indicates that nowadays, producing hydrogen from a grid connected PV-wind hybrid power system in renewable energy rich area (Qinghai Province) and delivering it via liquid hydrogen truck to a refueling station in east coast area (Shanghai) of China may be a feasible solution. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This resulted in 33 LNG pathways for which the energy efficiency, life cycle GHG emissions, and life cycle costs were determined by process-based material and energy flow analysis, life cycle assessment, and production cost calculation, respectively. The LNG and hydrogen supply chains were compared with a reference chain (coal or diesel) to determine avoided GHG emissions and GHG avoidance costs. Results show that NG with full cryogenic carbon dioxide capture (FCCC) is most beneficial pathway for both avoided GHG emissions and GHG avoidance costs (70.5–112.4 g CO2-e/MJLNG and 66.0–95.9 $/t CO2-e). The best case was obtained when NG with FCCC replaces coal-fired power plants. Results also indicate that hydrogen pathways requires maturation of new technology options and significant capital cost reductions to become attractive. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {As the use of fossil fuels becomes more and more restricted there is a need for alternative fuels also at sea. For short sea distance travel purposes, batteries may be a solution. However, for longer distances, when there is no possibility of recharging at sea, batteries do not have sufficient capacity yet. Several projects have demonstrated the use of compressed hydrogen (CH2) as a fuel for road transport. The experience with hydrogen as a maritime fuel is very limited. In this paper, the similarities and differences between liquefied hydrogen (LH2) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a maritime fuel will be discussed based on literature data of their properties and our system knowledge. The advantages and disadvantages of the two fuels will be examined with respect to use as a maritime fuel. Our objective is to discuss if and how hydrogen could replace fossil fuels on long distance sea voyages. Due to the low temperature of LH2 and wide flammability range in air these systems have more challenges related to storage and processing onboard than LNG. These factors result in higher investment costs. All this may also imply challenges for the LH2 supply chain. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing (AM) has provided new design and manufacturing opportunities to reduce cost and schedules, consolidate parts, and optimize performance. One technique being evaluated is Laser Powder Directed Energy Deposition (LP-DED), which provides a significant increase in scale compared to Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). NASA along with industry partners have been developing the LP-DED process to demonstrate internal channel geometry and development components for use in liquid rocket engine channel cooled nozzles. Optimized materials in the extreme high pressure and hydrogen environment for liquid rocket engines remains a key challenge. NASA has advanced an enabling material called NASA HR-1 (Hydrogen Resistant-1) as a solution using AM techniques. NASA HR-1 is a high-strength Fe-Ni superalloy designed to resist high pressure, hydrogen environment embrittlement, oxidation, and corrosion. NASA HR-1 meets materials requirements for liquid rocket engine components, including good hydrogen resistance, high conductivity, good low cycle fatigue performance, and high elongation and strength for components in high heat flux environments. Material properties and process characterization have been completed on the high density thin-wall material in addition to advancements of the supply chain. NASA has also completed fabrication of several subscale and full-scale channel wall nozzles in LP-DED NASA HR-1 and completed hot-fire testing. This includes refinement of the process to produce thin-walls and various channel geometries to meet the requirements for channel wall nozzle applications. This paper will provide an overview of the LP-DED process development, material characterization and properties, component manufacturing, and hot-fire testing. Hot-fire testing was completed for a lander-class 7K-lbf thrust chamber using Liquid Oxygen (LOX)/Methane. The design overview and results from hot-fire testing will be presented in addition to hardware development for future testing on 2K-lbf and 35k-lbf thrust chambers and large-scale manufacturing technology demonstrators. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc..

Although, nowadays, responsiveness and social responsibility of networks could also be regarded as important measures that could attract more consumers to use hydrogen. Accordingly, this paper aims to improve the reliability and social responsibility of a hydrogen supply chain along with its economic and environmental aspects. To ensure the network's responsiveness, a new objective function is extended that maximizes the reliability of products' delivery. Also, a novel reliability approach is developed to immune the network against disruptions. As a new sustainability indicator, social factors are considered in the design of the hydrogen supply chain. Finally, a mixed possibilistic flexible programming method is proposed to assure the outputs' reliability. The results illustrate that by 28.4% enhancement in cost objective, the value of environmental, social, and reliability objectives are desirably improved 39.2%, 45.6%, and 24.1%, respectively. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

The aim is to identify the best hydrogen infrastructure pathways while taking into account local factors such as the location of the hydrogen supply and demand, and distribution between the hydrogen production location and hydrogen demand points. The proposed model is a mixed integer linear program that is solved with AIMMS. The model is solved as a multi-criterion decision making problem, where three objectives (costs, safety, and environmental impact) are balanced. A three dimensional Pareto front is created using the epsilon constraint method. Utopia point analysis is used to make trade-off decisions in the Pareto front. Compared to the current internal combustion vehicle fuel with an average cost of 0.0645 $ per km, the hydrogen cost, of 0.0762 $ per km, proofs the potential for a hydrogen economy.

This research was carried out to investigate hydrogen demand and determine the optimum hydrogen delivery network employing truck transportation. Peninsular Malaysia was taken as a case study. The hydrogen demand was determined using two method: Firstly, by assuming that the hydrogen demand in Peninsular Malaysia as a function of total vehicle numbers, average total distance traveled and vehicle fuel economy were measured. While the second method investigated based on the current supply of gasoline and diesel from surveys on local petrol stations in Peninsular Malaysia. As a result, the second method was found as more accurate method and adopted as the overall energy demand in Peninsular Malaysia. Objective function for total investment cost for the future hydrogen infrastructure was developed based on the production technologies, type of transport, type of storage, product phase and plant type. The model was solved based on MILP using GAMS. Finally from the result, it can be concluded that liquefied hydrogen produced by natural gas steam reforming and delivered via tanker trucks is the optimum hydrogen supply chain method due to the minimum cost. © 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

	abstract = {                             Currently, a significant transformation for energy systems has emerged as a result of the trend to develop an energy framework without fossil fuel reliance, the concerns about climate change and air quality, and the need to provide electricity to around of 17% of world population who lacks the service. Accordingly, the deployment of power plants located close to end-users and including multiple energy sources and carriers, along with the growing share of renewable energies, have suggested changes in the energy sector. Despite their potential capabilities, the design of distributed energy systems (DES) is a complex problem due to the simultaneous goals and constraints that need to be considered, as well as to the high context dependence of this kind of projects. For these reasons, in this work a systematic literature review of DES including hydrogen as energy vector, was made analyzing 106 research papers published between the years 2000–2018, and extracted from Scopus                             ®                              and Web of Science databases. The aim was to identify how hydrogen is employed (technologies, uses) and the criteria that are evaluated (economic, technical, social and environmental) when these systems are designed, planned and/or operated. The results constitute a baseline information covering the type of technologies, equipment sizes and hydrogen applications, that could be valuable for the preliminary stages of research or project planning of DES involving hydrogen. Furthermore, other factors have also been identified, such as the focus on techno-economic issues, and the lack of considering socio/political aspects and the uncertainty about input data like weather conditions, energy prices and demands. Additionally, a more integrated approach is needed including all the hydrogen supply chain stages and project stakeholders, to tackle issues like safety of the energy systems that could produce consumer rejections.                          © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {The substantial expansion of renewable energy sources is creating the foundation to successfully transform the German energy sector (the so-called ‘Energiewende’). A by-product of this development is the corresponding capacity demand for the transportation, distribution and storage of energy. Hydrogen produced by electrolysis offers a promising solution to these challenges, although the willingness to invest in hydrogen technologies requires the identification of competitive and climate-friendly pathways in the long run. Therefore, this paper employs a pathway analysis to investigate the use of renewable hydrogen in the German passenger car transportation sector in terms of varying market penetration scenarios for fuel cell-electric vehicles (FCEVs). The investigation focuses on how an H2 infrastructure can be designed on a national scale with various supply chain networks to establish robust pathways and important technologies, which has not yet been done. Therefore, the study includes all related aspects, from hydrogen production to fueling stations, for a given FCEV market penetration scenario, as well as the CO2 reduction potential that can be achieved for the transport sector. A total of four scenarios are considered, estimating an FCEV market share of 1–75% by the year 2050. This corresponds to an annual production of 0.02–2.88 million tons of hydrogen. The findings show that the most cost-efficient H2 supply (well-to-tank: 6.7–7.5 €/kgH2)can be achieved in high demand scenarios (FCEV market shares of 30% and 75%)through a combination of cavern storage and pipeline transport. For low-demand scenarios, however, technology pathways involving LH2 and LOHC truck transport represent the most cost-efficient options (well-to-tank: 8.2–11.4 €/kgH2). © 2019},

	abstract = {Low-temperature heat sources are ubiquitous. Harvesting this heat in an efficient and cost-effective way improve overall systems efficiency and reduce energy costs. Numerous studies shed light on these sources and technologies to utilize low-temperature heat. This paper evaluates the technical and economic feasibility of low-temperature Stirling Engine (SE) powered by hot water energy from evacuated tube solar water heater for distributed power generation when excess hot water energy is available. Evacuated tube solar collector provides hot water on-demand. When hot water is not consumed domestically, a SE is used to utilize the untapped heat from the solar water heater. The objective of this study is to evaluate the energy savings by using a SE to recover untapped heat from solar collectors. Thermal performance of the selected evacuated tube was measured experimentally under local weather conditions for different periods in summer and winter in the Mediterranean region and then simulated on hourly basis for a whole year to estimate the energy and hot water temperature output. Three different cases were taken to assess the potential of energy savings using SE to generate power namely, typical homes, office buildings and schools. SE is modeled using the most advanced thirdorder design analysis method. Air, helium, and hydrogen are used as working fluids in the SE at different charging pressures. Results obtained from solar collector's thermal performance for the three cases are integrated with the results achieved from Stirling engine simulation of the various working fluids and pressures to evaluate the engine performance based on a dynamic approach. The study also investigates the economic feasibility of using Stirling engines for power generation from such low-temperature, intermittent heat sources. Results show that using hydrogen as working fluid is the most feasible. Typical schools show the most economical case to recover heat Copyright © 2017 ASME.},

	abstract = {There is an ongoing debate over future decarbonisation of gas networks using biomethane, and increasingly hydrogen, in gas network infrastructure. Some emerging research presents gas network decarbonisation options as a tractable alternative to ‘all-electric’ scenarios that use electric appliances to deliver the traditional gas services such as heating and cooking. However, there is some uncertainty as to the technical feasibility, cost and carbon emissions of gas network decarbonisation options. In response to this debate the Sustainable Gas Institute at Imperial College London has conducted a rigorous systematic review of the evidence surrounding gas network decarbonisation options. The study focuses on the technologies used to generate biomethane and hydrogen, and examines the technical potentials, economic costs and emissions associated with the full supply chains involved. The following summarises the main findings of this research. The report concludes that there are a number of options that could significantly decarbonise the gas network, and doing so would provide energy system flexibility utilising existing assets. However, these options will be more expensive than the existing gas system, and the GHG intensity of these options may vary significantly. In addition, more research is required, particularly in relation to the capabilities of existing pipework to transport hydrogen safely. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

As hydrogen production can be based on a broad variety of technologies already existing or under development, a comprehensive assessment of the different supply chains is necessary regarding not only costs but also diverse environmental impacts. Therefore, in this paper, a broad variety of hydrogen production technologies using different energy sources, renewable and fossil, are exemplarily assessed with the help of a Life Cycle Assessment and a cost assessment for Germany. As environmental impacts, along with the impact category Climate change, five more advanced impact categories are assessed. The results show that from an environmental point of view, PEM and alkaline electrolysis are characterized by the lowest results in five out of six impact categories. Supply chains using fossil fuels, in contrast, have the lowest supply costs; this is true, e.g., for steam methane reforming. Solar powered hydrogen production shows low impacts during hydrogen production but high impacts for transport and distribution to Germany. There is no single supply chain that is the most promising for every aspect assessed here. Either costs have to be lowered further or supply chains with selected environmental impacts have to be modified. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Today's market for small satellites is expanding, but there is little capacity for affordable, dedicated launches. Launch costs of less than â‚¬50,000 per kg are required to compete with piggyback options and ride-shares; hence, cost reduction is essential. Fourteen European companies and institutes have joined forces in a Horizon2020 project called â€œSMall Innovative Launcher for Europeâ€ (SMILE). The project aims at designing a launcher for satellites up to 70 kg and a European launch facility in northern Norway. Furthermore, the readiness level of critical technologies on propulsion, avionics, and cost-effective manufacturing is increased. As the development time of small satellites can be quite short, the launch rate (time-to-launch) is considered a key requirement. An effective and efficient organisation, including supply chain, is needed to maintain the launch cadence and to reduce operational cost, both of which are needed to deliver a commercially viable service. Both liquid and hybrid rocket engines are considered for this small launcher. The reusable LOX/kerosene liquid engine, for which hot firing tests have been performed in September 2018, uses a ceramic-based, transpiration cooled combustion chamber and a 3D-printed injector. The H2O2/HTPB hybrid engine technology offers simplicity of the architecture and uses green, storable propellants, and was successfully tested in July 2018. Upgrades from the existing engines have been performed, increasing the performances and reducing the dry mass. With a choice of two types of engines, different configurations have been analysed in a two- or three-stage set-up using a multidisciplinary design approach including steps from geometry set-up to trajectory optimisation. Preliminary cost estimations and readiness levels are used as complementary metrics. A trade-off was performed to select materials and structural elements to withstand the most demanding loading cases. To minimise the mass, composite sandwich structures have been selected. A suitable automated manufacturing process will increase cost-effectiveness. To accommodate both CubeSats and micro-satellites, a flexible payload adapter has been designed. The use of COTS for the avionics will further reduce cost, with low-cost MEMS gyroscopes competing with high-performance fibre optic gyroscopes. High-performance multi-processor System-On-chips can combine processing power, real-time control, and high number of interfaces into a single board. Finally, a new launch site design, including preliminary ground and flight safety analysis, has been performed for the launch base in Northern Norway, currently already used for sounding rockets launches.

	abstract = {The liquid hydrogen demand, particularly driven by clean energy applications, will rise in the near future. As industrial large scale liquefiers will play a major role within the hydrogen supply chain, production capacity will have to increase by a multiple of today's typical sizes. The main goal is to reduce the total cost of ownership for these plants by increasing energy efficiency with innovative and simple process designs, optimized in capital expenditure. New concepts must ensure a manageable plant complexity and flexible operability. In the phase of process development and selection, a dimensioning of key equipment for large scale liquefiers, such as turbines and compressors as well as heat exchangers, must be performed iteratively to ensure technological feasibility and maturity. Further critical aspects related to hydrogen liquefaction, e.g. fluid properties, ortho-para hydrogen conversion, and coldbox configuration, must be analysed in detail.

	abstract = {The United States (US) National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and its US industry partners are developing extreme-temperature composite nozzle extensions for a variety of cryogenic liquid rocket engine propulsion systems. Applications under consideration at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) include launch vehicle (upper stage), in-space, and lunar lander descent/ascent propulsion systems. Composite material systems of interest include carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon/silicon-carbide (C-SiC) composites, as well as modified versions of such composites (coatings, mixed matrices, oxidation inhibitors, etc.). Missions addressed include access to low Earth orbit, the lunar surface, and more distant destinations. Cryogenic upper-stage and in-space liquid rocket engines are optimized for performance through the use of high area ratio nozzles to fully expand combustion gases to low exit pressures, increasing exhaust velocities. As a result of the large size of such nozzles, and the related engine performance requirements, composite nozzle extensions are being considered to reduce mass impacts. Currently, metallic and foreign composite nozzle extensions used on the Atlas V, Delta IV, Falcon 9, and Ariane 5 launch vehicles represent the state-of-the-art. Such extensions are limited to use at or slightly above 2000°F (1093°C). Materials under development by MSFC and its industry partners have the potential to operate at temperatures up to (or above) 4250°F (2343°C). Marshall Space Flight Center efforts are aimed at (a) further developing the technology and databases needed to enable the use of composite nozzle extensions on cryogenic liquid rocket engines, (b) developing and demonstrating low-cost capabilities for testing and qualifying such nozzle extensions, and (c) advancing the US domestic supply chain for nozzle extensions. Through the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Programs, low-level internal MSFC research projects, and teaming arrangements with domestic industry partners, composite material design, development, hot-fire test, and evaluation efforts are progressing. Hot-fire engine tests of subscale hardware have been conducted using oxygen/hydrogen (LOX/H2), oxygen/methane (LOX/CH4), and oxygen/kerosene (LOX/RP-1) propellants. These engine tests at MSFC have enabled the evaluation of both heritage and state-of-the-art material systems, demonstrating the initial capabilities of the extreme temperature materials and their fabrication methods. Recent, ongoing, and potential future work supporting cryogenic propulsion systems development is presented below. The composite nozzle extension technology and test capabilities being developed are intended to support both NASA and US Department of Defense requirements, as well as those of the broader Commercial Space industry.

	abstract = {Commercial and military aviation is faced with challenges that include high fuel costs, undesirable emissions, and supply chain insecurity that result from the reliance on petroleum-based feedstocks. The development of alternative gas turbine fuels from renewable resources will likely be part of addressing these issues. The United States has established a target for one billion gallons of renewable fuels to enter the supply chain by 2018. These alternative fuels will have to be very similar in properties, chemistry, and composition to existing fuels. To further this goal, the National Jet Fuel Combustion Program (a collaboration of multiple U.S. agencies under the auspices of the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA) is coordinating measurements on three reference gas turbine fuels to be used as a basis of comparison. These fuels are reference fuels with certain properties that are at the limits of experience. These fuels include a low viscosity, low flash point, high hydrogen content "best case" JP-8 (POSF 10264) fuel, a relatively high viscosity, high flash point, low hydrogen content "worst case" JP-5 (POSF 10259) fuel, and a Jet-A (POSF 10325) fuel with relatively average properties. A comprehensive speciation of these fuels is provided in this paper by use of high resolution gas chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC/QToF-MS), which affords unprecedented resolution and exact molecular formula capabilities. The volatility information as derived from the measurement of the advanced distillation curve temperatures, Tk and Th, provides an approximation of the vapor-liquid equilibrium, and examination of the composition channels provides detailed insight into thermochemical data. A comprehensive understanding of the compositional and thermophysical data of gas turbine fuels is required not only for comparison but also for modeling of such complex mixtures, which will, in turn, aid in the development of new fuels with the goals of diversified feedstocks, decreased pollution, and increased efficiency. © 2016 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {NASA and industry partners are working towards fabrication process development to reduce costs and schedules associated with manufacturing liquid rocket engine components with the goal of reducing overall mission costs. One such technique being evaluated is powder-bed fusion or selective laser melting (SLM), commonly referred to as additive manufacturing (AM). The NASA Low Cost Upper Stage Propulsion (LCUSP) program was designed to develop processes and material characterization for GRCop-84 (a NASA Glenn Research Center-developed copper, chrome, niobium alloy) commensurate with powder-bed AM, evaluate bimetallic deposition, and complete testing of a full scale combustion chamber. As part of this development, the process has been transferred to industry partners to enable a long-term supply chain of monolithic copper combustion chambers. To advance the processes further and allow for optimization with multiple materials, NASA is also investigating the feasibility of bimetallic AM chambers. In addition to the LCUSP program, NASA has completed a series of development programs and hot-fire tests to demonstrate SLM GRCop-84 and other AM techniques. NASA's efforts include a 4K lbf thrust liquid oxygen/methane (LOX/CH4) combustion chamber and subscale thrust chambers for 1.2K lbf LOX/hydrogen (H2) applications that have been designed and fabricated with SLM GRCop-84. The same technologies for these lower thrust applications are being applied to 25-35K lbf main combustion chamber (MCC) designs. This paper describes the design, development, manufacturing and testing of these numerous combustion chambers, and the associated lessons learned throughout their design and development processes.},

	abstract = {As global energy demand rises, natural gas now plays an important strategic role in energy supply. It is more difficult to transport and store gas than oil and consequently it lagged behind that commodity for a considerable period. Over the last couple of decades this has changed and gas markets continue to expand more rapidly than those of other fossil fuels. Natural gas is the cleanest and most hydrogen-rich of all the hydrocarbon energy sources and it has high energy conversion efficiencies for power generation. Of more significance is that gas resources discovered but as yet unexploited remain plentiful. The sector is poised for considerable growth over the next two decades and some believe that it may even overtake oil as the prime fuel between 2020 and 2030. The trend towards natural gas becoming the premium fuel of the world economy is not now easily reversible. The key and the challenge for the energy industry is how that transition is to be managed. We examine in this paper sources of natural gas, their limitations and potential. We also identify the technological and commercial challenges to be overcome in taking the world through the transition. There is a fundamental turn towards natural gas which today accounts for about 23% of the world energy demand. Large capital investments in infrastructure to enable increased gas consumption are being made on both demand and supply sides. Several gas-producing countries have embarked upon very ambitious plans for markedly increased gas output. Many new LNG facilities are being built supply chains diversifying and becoming ever more flexible. There is a growing recognition that unconventional sources of gas, such as shale gas, coal bed methane (CBM) and deep tight gas will contribute a significant component of future gas supplies as technologies evolve. Other gas conversion technologies such as GTL and CNG are attracting more serious attention, but energy efficiency, cost and cost inflation remain barriers for these promising alternatives. Natural gas is also competing strongly with other fossil fuels from an efficiency and emissions perspective as the fuel of choice for power generation. However, gas price volatility and security of supply concerns means that some power generators still favor coal and nuclear components in their power generation portfolio. As the cost of carbon emissions have a bigger impact around the world, gas has the potential to increase its share of the power generation market significantly over the coming decade. A rapid growth opportunity exists for natural gas in its potential contribution to transportation either directly or by electrifying the sector. Real and imagined environmental concerns and restricted access for OECD nations to long-term oil reserves are expected to accelerate the emergence of hydrogen fuel cells. Currently available technologies dictate that the most commercially viable source of hydrogen in large quantities is natural gas, particularly methane through the reforming processes that yield synthesis gas (i.e. carbon monoxide and hydrogen). Current technologies, investments and consumption trends suggest that natural gas will be at the center of a worldwide transformation resulting in a greatly expanded market share of gas in the energy mix for power generation, space heating, petrochemical feedstocks and transportation fuels (e.g. natural gas vehicles are now on the agenda for both energy efficiency and lower emissions reasons). © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

With a growing interest in offshore resources and considering the capacity of offshore renewable resources, they are anticipated to contribute a larger share of electric power in the next decade. The existing dispatch of offshore wind electricity through offshore substation and sub-sea cables increases the cost of offshore electricity manifold. The offshore wind electricity can be dispatched by conversion into hydrogen and transportation through existing offshore gas pipeline infrastructure. The study presents a novel idea of performing the methanation process entirely offshore by utilizing CCS in conjunction with electrolysis. A proposal of an artificial island that hosts the complete offshore power-to-gas is also presented.

	abstract = {Nowadays the shortages of energy and water resources, the increasing prices, the demand for and dependence on fossil fuels and a growing environmental consciousness, have become societal priorities. These concerns have supported the development of alternative transportation fuels and the use of renewable sources of energy. Thus, governments across the globe have set targets on fossil fuels' substitutions over the next decade. In order to be able to meet these targets, not only process designs for the productions of alternative fuels are needed, but also the development of the networks which account for all the stages from the energy source to the final product. Biomass, in particular, is a challenging resource because of its seasonality, its degradation over time, its low density, regional availability, growth yield, and the large area required to grow it. However, biomass can provide a reasonable alternative to crude-based gasoline and diesel in the short and medium terms, although the competitiveness of biomass as an energy source is highly dependent on its supply chain. Lately, several studies have extended the supply-chain studies to actual regions across the US, but only for a limited number of raw materials and fuels, focusing mainly on lignocellulosic resources and in most of the cases only for bioethanol production, although FT-products have also been accounted for [1,2]. This contribution deals with a sustainable large-scale biorefinery supply network by considering both economic and environmental objectives. A biorefinery's supply network accounts for different biomass sources (algae, lignocellulosic materials, corn, wheat, cooking oil), conversion technologies (biochemical, thermochemical, thermo-biochemical, oil extraction, transesterification) and includes first, second, and third generations of biofuels, such as bioethanol, biodiesel, hydrogen, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, and green gasoline [3] accounting for water consumption and availability and energy integration within the network. Multi-period synthesis of an optimally-integrated biorefinery supply network [4] was performed through maximization of the economic objective, and applied on the case study of the European Union [5]. In this contribution the synthesis has now been extended to simultaneously accounting for environmental impact. The concept of Eco-and Total profit [6] was used for this purpose, which offers two important advantages over conventional multi-objective approaches: i) the concept accounts for both, burdening and unburdening effects [6] on the environment, as Eco-Profit is defined as the difference between Eco-Benefit (unburdening) and Eco-Cost (burdening), expressed in monetary terms. ii) by applying the concept where multi-objective solutions are reduced into single-objective ones as Total profit is composed of both, economic and Eco-profits. This enables the obtaining of sustainable solutions directly, which is especially important when solving supply network problems at the continental level when the models are huge. The solutions obtained for the case study of the European Union are those alternatives that would unburden the environment the most while having significant profit.},

	abstract = {The increasing global demand for petroleum-based fuels, mainly driven by the economic growth in emerging markets imposes significant challenges in terms of energy supply and environmental mitigation strategies. This work introduces an approach for the design and decision making of primary energy source, production, storage, and distribution networks for hydrogen supply in regions (or countries) under emission constraints. The problem was mathematically represented using a source-sink system approach to determine the most suitable hydrogen supply chain (HSC) network. The optimization problem was formulated as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model using GAMS® modeling system. The optimization objective consists of the minimization of the total network cost, both in terms of capital and operating expenditures, subject to: supply, demand, mass conservation, technical performance, economic, and environmental constraints. The model was used to plan the future hydrogen supply chain network for Germany in the year 2030 under emission constraints. The optimization results show that the model is a valuable tool for planning the optimal hydrogen supply chain network of a particular region or country. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

With the proposed approach we can identify the optimal design of the supply chain and main cost-drivers, manage logistics operations against fluctuations of biomass availability and hydrogen demand, and make strategic decisions for planning the B2H2 system such as capital investment and energy import planning.

	abstract = {A design for manufacture and assembly (DFMATM) analysis is applied to future bus and automotive fuel cell vehicle (FCV) system designs. This DFMATM analysis is used to identify (1) optimal fuel cell system (FCS) operating parameters for system cost minimization, (2) FCV designs appropriate for volume manufacture, (3) FCV manufacturing supply chain designs, (4) projected future capital costs of FCVs at varying manufacturing rates, and (5) primary cost drivers. This DFMATM analysis focuses on the FCS drive train. It excludes fuel storage, the electric drive drain, and all other parts of the vehicle (chassis, exterior, etc.). These FCSs are envisioned to use low temperature proton exchange membrane (LT PEM) stacks to convert hydrogen fuel into electric power. Models are developed to minimize LT PEM fuel cell system costs by finding the cost optimal combination of (1) stack operating pressure, (2) cell voltage, (3) platinum (Pt) catalyst loading, (4) stoichiometric ratio of oxygen, and (5) coolant stack exit temperature. A multi-variable Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis indicates, with 90% confidence, that a FCS producing peak net 160 kilowatt-electric (kWe) for a bus application and produced at a rate of 1,000 FCS/year (yr) is expected to cost between $251/kWe and $334/kWe. Similarly, a peak net 80 kWe automotive FCS manufactured at a rate of 500,000 FCSs/year is estimated to cost between $51/kWe and $65/kWe, with 90% confidence. Total FCS costs are the sum of PEM stack and balance of plant (BOP) costs. The BOP components represent 32% of the bus FCS costs and 48% of the automotive system cost. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.},

The liquefaction energy consumption was inversely proportional to the ortho concentration. The simulation of the pressurisation in an prismatic pressure vessel showed that the design pressure increased with the ortho concentration: 5.1, 5.7, 7.9 and 11.5 bara for the ortho concentrations of 2%, 10%, 20% and 30%, respectively. This trend caused the loading limit to decrease at higher ortho concentrations, thus critically affecting the LH2 shipping economics.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is an energy carrier that represents a possible clean fuel of the future. This paper assesses the effect of biomass co-firing on gasification based hydrogen production supply chain, with carbon dioxide capture and storage, from technical, economical and environmental point of view. Several cases consisting of various feedstocks to the gasification reactor are investigated (coal only and coal in mixture with sawdust or wheat straw). Considered plant concepts generate between 330 and 460. MW hydrogen of 99.99% (vol.) purity.First a performance analysis regarding the energy efficiency of the process, the syngas composition and the carbon dioxide capture rate is carried out. The simulations are made using chemical process simulation software Aspen Plus. Second, total capital investment and operating costs for the gasification plant are evaluated. Finally, using the results from Aspen Plus simulations and the cost estimations, a discrete event model is developed, to address hydrogen production supply chain analysis under demand variability, with Arena software. The implications of biomass co-firing on the system are evaluated in terms of: hydrogen amount sold and hydrogen amount stored (MW), hydrogen lost sales amount (MW), partial sales percent and gasification plant profit.The results show that as the biomass quantity in the feedstock increases the hydrogen production rate decreases by 9-28% for sawdust, respectively by 7-23% for wheat straw. The energy efficiency of the process and the gasification plant profit also decrease, but the CO2 emissions are lower for the cases of biomass co-firing. © 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

	abstract = {For an energy supply chain based on liquefied hydrogen, low parasitic energy consumption throughout the chain, from conversion to end-use, is a prerequisite for competitiveness with other energy carriers. The viability of the chain from the viewpoint of efficiency and cost is to a large extent dependent on the efficiency of the liquefier, which is the dominant power-consuming process in the chain. Hence, an innovative large-scale, high-efficiency hydrogen liquefier based on mixed-refrigerant (MR) pre-cooling has been developed. The liquefier employs MR pre-cooling down to a hydrogen temperature of 75 K while below this temperature, a reversed helium/neon Brayton cycle provides the requisite cooling. Two MR-based liquefier models have been derived. In the first, Joule-Thomson throttling valves are employed for MR expansion, while these have been replaced with liquid expanders in the second. With 21 bar hydrogen feed pressure and an ambient temperature of 300 K, the resulting figures for specific liquefaction power are 6.48 and 6 . 15 kWh / kgLH2, respectively. Based on current models, a reduction in the range of 45-48% from that of state-of-the art may be obtainable. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen as a clean alternative energy carrier for the future is required to be produced through environmentally friendly approaches. Use of renewables such as wind energy for hydrogen production is an appealing way to securely sustain the worldwide trade energy systems. In this approach, wind turbines provide the electricity required for the electrolysis process to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen. The generated hydrogen can then be stored and utilized later for electricity generation via either a fuel cell or an internal combustion engine that turn a generator. In this study, techno-economic evaluation of hydrogen production by electrolysis using wind power investigated in a windy location, named Binaloud, located in north-east of Iran. Development of different large scale wind turbines with different rated capacity is evaluated in all selected locations. Moreover, different capacities of electrolytic for large scale hydrogen production is evaluated. Hydrogen production through wind energy can reduce the usage of unsustainable, financially unstable, and polluting fossil fuels that are becoming a major issue in large cities of Iran.

	abstract = {A core theme of the UK Government's new Industrial Strategy is exploiting opportunities for domestic supply chain development. This extends to a special ‘Automotive Sector Deal’ that focuses on the shift to low emissions vehicles (LEVs). Here attention is on electric vehicle and battery production and innovation. In this paper, we argue that a more straightforward gain in terms of framing policy around potential economic benefits may be made through supply chain activity to support refuelling of battery/hydrogen vehicles. We set this in the context of LEV refuelling supply chains potentially replicating the strength of domestic upstream linkages observed in the UK electricity and/or gas industries. We use input-output multiplier analysis to deconstruct and assess the structure of these supply chains relative to that of more import-intensive petrol and diesel supply. A crucial multiplier result is that for every £1million of spending on electricity (or gas), 8 full-time equivalent jobs are supported throughout the UK. This compares to less than 3 in the case of petrol/diesel supply. Moreover, the importance of service industries becomes apparent, with 67% of indirect and induced supply chain employment to support electricity generation being located in services industries.

Hydrogen production supply chain system is evaluated in terms of: hydrogen amount sold and hydrogen amount stored (MW-h), hydrogen lost sales amount (MW-h), partial sales per cent and gasification plant profit (MM Euros). Hydrogen production supply chain assessment under demand variability provide a “what if” analysis and help foresee how hydrogen demand variability, hydrogen delivery distance variation and hydrogen production cost variation would affect the entire biomass gasification based hydrogen production supply chain, especially the gasification plant, during one year time frame (8000 working hours). In order to reduce the wood chips quality degradation and dry matter losses risks over the storage period and to meet the gasification reactor requirements in terms of raw material properties a stock optimization is performed in Arena OptQuest resulting in a decrease of wood chips stock at the gasification plant and at the biomass warehouse. Hydrogen demand variation result is a decrease of gasification plant profit. Also, hydrogen delivery distance influence on gasification plant profit is more pronounced when hydrogen demand variation is higher. © 2014 Universitatea Babes-Bolyai, Catedra de Filosofie Sistematica.

We develop an integrated systems dynamics model of New Zealand's energy and economic systems to examine the implications of policies to reduce the carbon intensity of the vehicle fleet under scenarios with different assumptions of technology improvement, consumer preferences, and oil prices. We model four competing vehicle technologies: petrol/diesel internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV), hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles (HICEV), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV). Consumers choose between vehicle types based on expected vehicle costs and calibrated preference parameters through a logit choice model. Engineering data are used to parameterise the modelling of hydrogen supply chains, future energy resources, and electricity markets. We focus our work on a set of scenarios that shed light on the different policy measures and assumptions about technology improvement that may be necessary to bring about large scale market penetration of HFCVs and BEVs. We then compare the resulting greenhouse gas emission profiles with a no-policy baseline characterised by an ICEV dominated fleet. We find a HICEV scenario provides similar results as the HFCV scenario, but with higher emissions, due to the lower fuel economy of HICEVs.},

	abstract = {With regard to the Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011 and Japan's goal to reduce CO2 emission, the Japanese government strives for an emission free “hydrogen society” in which hydrogen will be the primary energy medium. The import of hydrogen generated by means of CO2 free wind electricity from overseas can be a promising option for Japan's prospective energy supply. Besides different other factors like specific costs of electrolyzers and hydrogen shipment over long distances, the economically reasonable export of hydrogen based on renewable energy requires low levelized costs of electricity. Within the scope of this study, the underlying idea of a hydrogen supply chain is taken up and revisited by means of a spatially highly resolved wind energy potential analysis and a detailed investigation of the supply chain elements between Patagonia and Japan. Our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of the total land area in Patagonia would be eligible. Approx. 33,000 turbines with a minimum number of 4500 full-load hours with an overall capacity of about 115 GW can be positioned. Taking into consideration the related average number of 4750 full-load hours and an electrolysis efficiency of 0.7, this leads to a potential production of about 11.5 million tons/year of hydrogen. So the wind power potential of Patagonia would theoretically be sufficient for the assumed Japanese hydrogen demand of 8.83 million tons/year. The total hydrogen pretax cost would amount to approx. 4.40 €/kgH2 at a liquid state at the harbor of Yokohama. Hence, the final specific costs of hydrogen in Japan depend on the expansion of wind power in Patagonia and therefore hydrogen based on wind energy can be cost-competitive to conventional fuels. © 2018},

	abstract = {Fuel cell cars powered by hydrogen enable CO2-emission free mobility. A main requirement for the success of this technology is the availability of an area-wide and affordable hydrogen supply. A significant cost factor in the hydrogen supply chain is the multi-stage gas compression to provide the mandatory filling pressure for the pressurized tanks. One way to address this issue is to perform the hydrogen production process at elevated pressure. In this paper the feasibility of compressed hydrogen production without additional gas compression based on the steam iron process is discussed. Experiments were performed in a lab-scale test rig using fixed bed reactor technology. The focus was to evaluate the influence of pressurized hydrogen production on the cycle stability, on the conversion efficiency and on the structural integrity of a Fe2O3-Al2O3 (90 + 10 wt%) oxygen carrier. The oxidations were performed at different pressure levels of 7-22 bar (g) at a temperature of 750 °C with steam. The steady steam supply was ensured by a HPLC pump which delivered 0.03 g min-1 (at room temperature) of water, which was evaporated in the heated inlet section. The water was introduced for approximately 100 min until the oxygen carrier was fully oxidized. The iron oxide was reduced in the subsequent reaction steps at 750 °C and ambient pressure with 25 Nml min-1 H2 as reducing agent. The reduction reactions were analyzed to evaluate possible influences of its prior oxidations. The results revealed no signs of negative repercussions. The oxygen carrier conversion of initially 84% remained at a steady behavior between the 15 performed cycles. Only small losses of 0.8% per cycle caused by thermal sintering of the contact mass were observed, which was independent from the different pressure levels of the prior oxidations. The evaluation of the pressurized oxidations did not reveal any performance decrease as well. The rise of pressure in each oxidation showed a consistent characteristic throughout the complete test series. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of the oxygen carrier sample after the experiment revealed some structural changes, which are related to thermal sintering but the structural integrity of the sample stayed intact. The oxidations yielded an average of 18 mmol gFe-1 hydrogen with a maximum hydrogen pressure of 22 bar (g). The conducted experiments showed that the steam iron process is very suitable for the production of compressed hydrogen and that the process is not negatively influenced by the elevated system pressure. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

The hydrogen is transported by a) the natural gas grid and reclaimed by the existing steam reformer, b) an own pipeline and c) hydrogen trailers. The analysis is applied to the city of Hamburg, Germany, for two scenarios of installed renewable energy capacities. The annual course of excess renewable power is modeled in a coupled system approach and the replaceable hydrogen mass flow rate is determined using measurement data from an existing refinery. Dynamic simulations are performed using an open-source Modelica® library. It is found that in all three alternative hydrogen supply chains CO2 emissions can be reduced and costs are increased compared to the reference case. Transporting hydrogen via the natural gas grid is the least efficient but achieves the highest emission reduction and is the most economical alternative for small to medium amounts of hydrogen. Using a hydrogen pipeline is the most efficient option and slightly cheaper for large amounts than employing the natural gas grid. Transporting hydrogen by trailers is not economical for single consumers and realizes the lowest CO2 reductions. © 2018 The Authors},

	abstract = {Different technologies produce hydrogen with varying cost and carbon footprints over the entire resource supply chain and manufacturing steps. This paper examines the relative costs of carbon mitigation from a life cycle perspective for 12 different hydrogen production techniques using fossil fuels, nuclear energy and renewable sources by technology substitution. Production costs and life cycle emissions are parameterized and re-estimated from currently available assessments to produce robust ranges to describe uncertainties for each technology. Hydrogen production routes are then compared using a combination of metrics, levelized cost of carbon mitigation and the proportional decarbonization benchmarked against steam methane reforming, to provide a clearer picture of the relative merits of various hydrogen production pathways, the limitations of technologies and the research challenges that need to be addressed for cost-effective decarbonization pathways. The results show that there is a trade-off between the cost of mitigation and the proportion of decarbonization achieved. The most cost-effective methods of decarbonization still utilize fossil feedstocks due to their low cost of extraction and processing, but only offer moderate decarbonisation levels due to previous underestimations of supply chain emissions contributions. Methane pyrolysis may be the most cost-effective short-term abatement solution, but its emissions reduction performance is heavily dependent on managing supply chain emissions whilst cost effectiveness is governed by the price of solid carbon. Renewable electrolytic routes offer significantly higher emissions reductions, but production routes are more complex than those that utilise naturally-occurring energy-dense fuels and hydrogen costs are high at modest renewable energy capacity factors. Nuclear routes are highly cost-effective mitigation options, but could suffer from regionally varied perceptions of safety and concerns regarding proliferation and the available data lacks depth and transparency. Better-performing fossil-based hydrogen production technologies with lower decarbonization fractions will be required to minimise the total cost of decarbonization but may not be commensurate with ambitious climate targets. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {In the automotive sector, few changes are more disruptive than moving powertrains away from the century-long tradition of liquid petroleum fueling. Powertrain development is one of the largest areas of long-term investments in the automotive sector, requiring research, development and testing years before production and significant commitments of capital by the OEM and suppliers to establish and sustain complex vertical production systems. Once in series production, incremental improvements ("kaizen") will be expected to keep the powertrain current through a decade or more of changing conditions in consumer needs, regulatory requirements, retail dealer sales & service, and supporting infrastructure. Powertrain systems are particularly dependent on externalities outside of the automaker and direct supply chain. Fuels, lubricants, additives, and other consumable materials must be readily available to consumers throughout the planned production run plus the expected vehicle lifespan, a period spanning multiple decades. Among non-petroleum power sources, fuel-cell hybrid vehicles powered by hydrogen offer the attractive potential of lower energy costs, reduced emissions and lower greenhouse gases, combined with the potential for quick, convenient and inexpensive refueling. Hydrogen powered vehicles face daunting obstacles and may require different business models to overcome current availability and distribution issues for refueling; concerns about refueling convenience and availability, range, and hydrogen safety must also be addressed. With challenging barriers on the vehicle-side, customer concerns about usability and unresolved infrastructure issues, one might weigh the potential future returns against the current costs of developing hydrogen-powered vehicles and find the risk too great. But high barriers to entry also mean that a successfully implemented advanced technology powertrain strategy paired with complementary business models and external infrastructure development can contribute to the success of the enterprise, offering high rewards for the OEM, suppliers and dealers, increasing innovation throughout the enterprise, and provide crucial brand differentiation along with other 'first-mover' advantages.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy carriers in the quest for a more sustainable energy mix. A model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on MILP formulation (Mixed Integer Linear Programming) in a multi-objective/multi-period version has been carried out in a previous work and applied to the region of Midi-Pyrénées. One objective is a cost function based on the total daily cost (TDC), encompassing capital and operational expenditures. Previous results have shown that the initiation of the hydrogen deployment is strongly penalized from an economic viewpoint. The objective of this work is to identify the major contributors to the cost function. For this purpose, a sensitivity analysis of the five main factors involved in the cost evaluation is performed using a design of experiments (DOE) methodology. The results show that the demand is, by far, the most significant factor in the model, followed by the capital change factor, the learning rate and then the production and storage capital cost. The best combination of factors is then used in an experimental run of the HSC model to compare the benefits obtained from our previous results, leading to a decrease in the number of storage facilities and favouring the long term investment plan.},

The objective of the present study was to investigate the use of a portable method with a single silica gel column for trapping/separation coupled with chemiluminescence detection (SCTS-CL) for measurement of methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide in sample air from pig production. Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to evaluate the trapping/separation. The silica gel column used for the SCTS-CL efficiently collected hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide. The measurement of methanethiol by SCTS-CL was clearly interfered by the high concentration of hydrogen sulfide found in pig production, and a removal of hydrogen sulfide was necessary to obtain reliable results. Air samples taken from a facility with growing-finishing pigs were analyzed by SCTS-CL, PTR-MS, and a gas chromatograph with sulfur chemiluminescence detection (GC-SCD) to evaluate the SCTS-CL. The difference between the concentrations of methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide measured with SCTS-CL, PTR-MS, and GC-SCD was below 10. In conclusion, the SCTS-CL is a portable and low-cost alternative to the commercial methods that can be used to measure methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide in sample air from pig production. © 2012 Michael Jorgen Hansen et al.},

	abstract = {In this presentation, three alternative hydrogen supply chains are investigated. After generation by means of an electrolyzer using surplus renewable power, the hydrogen is stored and transported by a) the natural gas grid and reclaimed by the existing steam reformer, b) an own pipeline and C) hydrogen trailers. The analysis is applied to the city of Hamburg, Germany, for the years of 2035 and 2050. For these years, the annual course of the excess power is determined by extrapolating the curves of volatile renewables and subtracting the annual demand curve. By analyzing measured data from an existing refinery in the south of Hamburg, the replaceable hydrogen flow rate is identified. The location of the power-to-gas plant is chosen considering the high voltage electricity grid, the high-pressure natural gas grid, and salt structures for storage caverns. For modeling the system components, the equation-based modeling language Modelica® is used and relevant dynamic effects are considered. The system elements are designed in such a way that overall costs are minimized. Annual dynamic simulations of the different hydrogen supply chains are performed. Hydrogen production costs, overall efficiencies, and CO2 emissions are determined and compared to the reference case in which hydrogen is produced by the existing steam reformer. It is found that a single-digit percentage of the overall hydrogen demand of the refinery can be substituted by renewable hydrogen. In all three alternative hydrogen supply chains, the CO2 emissions can be reduced while the efficiencies are lower and overall costs are higher compared to the reference case. Transporting the hydrogen via the natural gas grid is the least efficient but the most economical alternative. Using a pipeline is the most efficient option while it will strongly depend on the economic parameters if employing a pipeline or trailers is more cost effective.},

	abstract = {The Lan Do gas field was developed to supplement the depleting production at existing Lan Tay field. It is a crucial development as more than 22% of the electricity capacity for Vietnam is dependent on gas supply from Lan Tay production facilities. Gas from Lan Do field contains 1.2% CO2 which required corrosion resistant alloy for the flowline. 13Cr was selected at an early stage to take advantage of preferential procurement agreement with the pipe manufacturer and to gain on-time delivery. 13Cr can be a cost effective solution for sweet CO2 service. However, 13Cr is known to be susceptible to hydrogen induced stress cracking resulting from the high potential generated by normal cathodic protection system. Specific industry guidance on the method to address this risk is still maturing. Current solution has been essentially limited to proprietary developed diode controlled anode system. For this project, a proprietary designed diode controlled aluminium alloy anode system was used. The presence of carbon steel fittings, equipment and structures where normal aluminium anodes were attached, imposed a strict requirement for electrical isolation from the 13Cr flowline. Electrical isolation techniques such as monolithic isolation joints were used for the flowline connections, whereas Teflon coating was introduced to isolate the structures. Specific welding details between 13Cr and CRA clad pipes were made to address differing thicknesses between these materials. Among the challenges in the installation phase was to land the in-line sled structure on a seabed characterized by mounts, valleys and hard rocky outcrops. To achieve a level seabed, remedial measure using grout bags dumping was used. The amount of grout bags dumped was large, requiring about 250 m3 of grout bags at a water depth of 185 m, which was rarely done. This paper describes the innovative approaches taken to address the challenges in engineering the 13Cr flowline and solutions developed to enable construction and installation of the flowline system on a very rugged seabed. The flowline was successfully installed and received first gas on 7 October 2012. Copyright 2014, Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Abstract As a solid energy carrier, biomass generally has a few disadvantages, which limits its use for coal replacement and as a feedstock for entrained flow gasification. The hydrophilic and fibrous nature, the low calorific value and low bulk energy content imply high accumulated costs in the whole supply chain and severe challenges in more advanced conversion systems. By thermally pretreating the biomass by torrefaction, these properties may be significantly improved. A continuous torrefaction rotary drum reactor was designed, constructed and evaluated to enable an accurate process control and allow a homogeneous well-defined high quality product to be produced. The combined effects of torrefaction temperature (260-310 °C) and residence time (8-25 min) on a large number of product properties (> 25) were determined for Norway spruce. The resulting mass and energy yields were 46-97% and 62-99%, respectively. Exothermic reactions were evident both at low (260 °C) and high temperatures (310 °C) but with no thermal runaway observed. Increased torrefaction severity resulted in decreased milling energy consumption, angle of repose, mass and energy yield, content of volatile matter, hydrogen, cellulose and hemicellulose. Hydrophobicity, heating value, carbon and fixed carbon contents increased. For all responses, the effect of torrefaction temperature was larger than the effect of residence time. Substantial interaction effects were present for mass and energy yields, volatile matter and hydrogen content. Another correlation found was the relationship of hemicellulose degradation and the brittleness of the torrefied product. Data also suggest secondary char forming reactions during the torrefaction process, resulting in higher fixed carbon content in the torrefied material than expected. The results also suggest torrefaction temperature and residence time not to be totally interchangeable. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The objective is to consider not only cost efficiency, but also safety. Since there is a trade-off between these two objectives, formal multiobjective optimization techniques are required to establish the optimal Pareto solutions that can then be used for decision-making purposes. With the model, the effects of demand uncertainty can be also analyzed by comparing the deterministic and the stochastic solutions.

The transition from Ni-H2 to LIB technologies continues to have a significant impact on spacecraft designers, battery manufacturers, launch providers, and supply chain organizations. The most significant impact has been the cost penalties associated with complying to evolving LIB performance and test requirements needed to incorporate advanced spacecraft thermal, electrical, mechanical, and software design solutions. These cost impacts are partially offset by increases in electrical power subsystem (EPS) mass savings, reductions in thermal control subsystem complexity, and simplifications to battery management systems supporting LIB spacecraft operation. In addition, the risks associated with safe ground and flight operation of LIB’s has impacted how spacecraft providers design, test, and safely operate next-generation LIB power systems. This work analyzes the current state-of-practice (SoP) of Earth-orbiting satellite and launch vehicle LIB-based EPS as it applies to various mission applications.

	abstract = {Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions have been accelerated all over the world in an attempt to move toward a low-carbon society. We have investigated feasible measures to reduce CO2 emissions and have concluded that introduction of new fuels with near-zero CO2 emissions is required to achieve Japan's commitment of 80% CO2 reduction by 2050. Although it was originally thought that nuclear power is promising in this regard, it is difficult to increase nuclear power at the moment, especially in Japan. Although much attention has been paid to renewable energies like solar or wind power, these problems concerning the stability and mass supply still exist. Therefore, we have moved forward with focus on hydrogen. The use of hydrogen will not produce CO2 emissions, and the production of hydrogen produces limited CO2 emissions. In this context, we aim to realize a CO2-free hydrogen chain utilizing Australian brown coal linked with CCS (carbon capture and storage). Australia has abundant resources of unused brown coal and the Federal Government of Australia and the State Government of Victoria actively encourage effective use of brown coal. Simultaneously, they energetically promote plans for a CO2 storage hub (Carbon Net), led mainly by Victoria. This enables stable, economic production of CO2-free hydrogen. In a CO2-free hydrogen chain, hydrogen is produced from brown coal in Australia and then the hydrogen is liquefied and transported to Japan by a liquid hydrogen carrier. It is the world's first attempt to transport massive amounts of liquid hydrogen across the ocean. We have conducted a feasibility study on the CO2-free hydrogen chain at a commercial scale and the results show that this chain concept is technically and economically feasible.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is a typical contaminant generated in waste combustion, whose emission is strictly regulated. In order to cope with severe limits issued by local authorities on the annual mass flow of HCl emitted, several European waste-to-energy plants perform at least a two-stage abatement of the pollutant and operate with a set-point for HCl concentration at stack well below the hourly emission limit imposed by the Industrial Emissions Directive. Even though the operating conditions in a WtE facility are highly variable (both in terms of HCl release from the burnt waste and of operating temperature of the HCl removal system), it is common industrial practice to keep both the set-point for HCl concentration at stack and the set-point for HCl concentration between the two abatement stages at a constant value. However, this might force the abatement system to operate far from its design conditions and from the optimal reactivity window of the adopted HCl removal agent, thus increasing the consumption rate of reactant and the consequent generation rate of process residues. Both the supply chain of reactants and the management of residues generate environmental impacts. The present work demonstrates that the adoption of variable values for both set-points can provide cost savings and indirect environmental benefits, thanks to the reduction of reactant consumption and residue generation. By considering as case study a WtE plant equipped with a two-stage dry HCl removal system, a year of operation of the plant was analysed. The operating costs and life cycle impacts generated by the actual operation of the HCl treatment system with constant set-points were compared with those generated if the plant had operated with variable set-points, simulated with a semi-empirical model for HCl removal tuned on historical process data from the plant. A 13 % reduction of the life cycle global warming impact and an 8 % reduction of the life cycle acidification impact, in addition to 10 % cost savings, were associated to the utilisation of variable set-points.

	abstract = {Current energy research investment policy in New Zealand is based on assumed benefits of transitioning to hydrogen as a transport fuel and as storage for electricity from renewable resources. The hydrogen economy concept, as set out in recent commissioned research investment policy advice documents, includes a range of hydrogen energy supply and consumption chains for transport and residential energy services. The benefits of research and development investments in these advice documents were not fully analyzed by cost or improvements in energy efficiency or green house gas emissions reduction. This paper sets out a straightforward method to quantify the system-level efficiency of these energy chains. The method was applied to transportation and stationary heat and power, with hydrogen generated from wind energy, natural gas and coal. The system-level efficiencies for the hydrogen chains were compared to direct use of conventionally generated electricity, and with internal combustion engines operating on gas- or coal-derived fuel. The hydrogen energy chains were shown to provide little or no system-level efficiency improvement over conventional technology. The current research investment policy is aimed at enabling a hydrogen economy without considering the dramatic loss of efficiency that would result from using this energy carrier. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In recent years, new-found interest in the hydrogen economy from both industry and academia has helped to shed light on its potential. Hydrogen can enable an energy revolution by providing much needed flexibility in renewable energy systems. As a clean energy carrier, hydrogen offers a range of benefits for simultaneously decarbonizing the transport, residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Hydrogen is shown here to have synergies with other low-carbon alternatives, and can enable a more cost-effective transition to de-carbonized and cleaner energy systems. This paper presents the opportunities for the use of hydrogen in key sectors of the economy and identifies the benefits and challenges within the hydrogen supply chain for power-To-gas, power-To-power and gas-To-gas supply pathways. While industry players have already started the market introduction of hydrogen fuel cell systems, including fuel cell electric vehicles and micro-combined heat and power devices, the use of hydrogen at grid scale requires the challenges of clean hydrogen production, bulk storage and distribution to be resolved. Ultimately, greater government support, in partnership with industry and academia, is still needed to realize hydrogen's potential across all economic sectors. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

High-purity industrial facilities such as ammonia manufacturing, hydrogen production, and natural gas processing, which produce CO2 as a byproduct, are considered as candidates of CO2 sources. Two transportation modes to deliver CO2 from the source to the application site, truck and truck-rail intermodal, are considered. A mathematical model is developed to determine the optimal set of CO2 sources, the capacity of CO2 liquefaction facilities and storage tanks to be built at the selected sources and application sites, and the corresponding CO2 supply level and transportation mode, so that the overall cost is minimized. Since the original model is mixed-integer and non-convex, a two-stage algorithm is proposed to solve the model efficiently. A case study for North Dakota shale oil withdrawal is conducted to demonstrate the implementation of the model and the algorithm.},

This work is focused on the design of a hydrogen supply chain through mixed integer linear programming used to find the best solutions for a multi-objective optimization problem in which three objectives are involved, i.e., cost, global warming potential and safety risk. This problem is solved by implementing an É-constraint method. The solution consists of a Pareto front, corresponding to different design strategies in the associated variable space. Multiple choice decision making is then recommended to find the best solution through an M-TOPSIS analysis. The model is applied to the Great Britain case study previously treated in the dedicated literature.

	abstract = {Renewably produced hydrogen offers a solution for mobility via fuel cell electric vehicles without emissions during driving. However, the hydrogen supply chain, from hydrogen production to the fueling station – incorporating seasonal storage and transport – varies in economic and environmental aspects depending on the technology used, as well as individual conditions, such as the distance between production and demand. Previous studies have focused on the economic aspects of varying technologies and elaborated application areas of each technology, while environmental issues were not specifically considered. To address this shortcoming, this paper presents a life cycle assessment of three supply chain architectures: (a) Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHCs hereinafter) for transport and storage; as well as (b) compressed hydrogen storage in salt caverns, together with pipelines; and (c) pressurized gas truck transport. The results of this study show that the pipeline solution has the least environmental impact with respect to most of the impact categories for all analyzed cases. Only for short distances, i.e., 100 km, is truck transport better in a few impact categories. When considering truck transport scenarios, LOHCs have higher environmental impacts than pressurized gas in seven out of 14 impact categories. Nevertheless, for longer distances, the difference is decreasing. The seasonal storage of hydrogen has almost no environmental influence, independent of the impact category, transport distance or hydrogen demand. In particular, strong scaling effects underlie the good performance of pipeline networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We validated this newborn paper-based test in a cohort of 159 newborns at an obstetric hospital in Cabinda, Angola. Newborn screening results using the paper-based test were compared to conventional isoelectric focusing (IEF). The test detected the presence of HbS with 81.8% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity, and identified SCD newborns with 100.0% sensitivity and 70.7% specificity. The use of the paper-based test in a two-stage newborn screening process could have excluded about 70% of all newborns from expensive confirmatory testing by IEF, without missing any of the SCD newborns in the studied cohort. This study demonstrates the potential utility of the newborn paper-based test for reducing the overall cost of screening newborns for SCD and thus increasing the practicality of universal newborn SCD screening programs in resource-limited settings. © 2017 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Substitution of petro-based aviation fuel with biomass-derived aviation fuel is an emerging strategy to reduce the carbon footprint associated with the aviation sector. There are several pathways for the production of aviation biofuel, and most of them require the use of hydrogen. Therefore, the analysis of the aviation biofuel supply chain must incorporate the production of hydrogen. This paper presents an optimization approach for the strategic planning of aviation fuel supply chains, which considers hydrogen production from fossil and renewable raw materials. The approach also considers extraction of fossil materials, growth of biomass, selection and several processing routes of the feedstock, along with the distribution of products. As a case study, the strategic planning of aviation biofuels in Mexico considering the generation of biomass and the hydrogen production is selected. The results show that significant decreases in producing costs and CO2 emissions can be obtained if aviation fuel is generated from renewable raw materials. This finding is quite important, because in Mexico 90% of the consumed energy proceed from fossil sources. Several scenarios are addressed to assess the key factors in the design of the supply chain, reconciling the economic and environmental objectives; and also an analysis for the integration of the infrastructures of the fossil fuels and biorefineries is presented. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

In this paper, the integration of this renewable source in a hydrogen supply chain has been analysed with the following considerations, (1) the techno-economic modeling is applied over the 2020–2050 period, at a regional scale comprising the north of Spain, covering the main sources of surplus hydrogen in the region, (2) the supply chain feeds fuel cell devices powering stationary and mobile applications and, thereby stablishing the quality standards for the upcycled hydrogen and, (3) a mixed-integer programming model (MILP) is formulated to predict the optimal integration of surplus hydrogen. The advantages of this research are twofold, (i) on the one hand, it provides the methodology for the optimal use of surplus hydrogen gases promoting the shift to a Circular Economy and, (ii) on the other hand, it contributes to the penetration of renewable energies in the form of low cost fuel cell devices to power stationary and mobile applications. The results show that the combination of all the infrastructure elements into the mathematical formulation yields optimal solutions with a plan for the gradual infrastructure investments over time required for the transition towards a sustainable future energy mix that includes hydrogen. Thus, this work contributes to improving the environmental and economic sustainability of hydrogen supply chains of upcycling industrial surplus hydrogen. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this study, the authors developed an Optimal Power Generation Mix model, which takes into account the supply chain of imported and domestically produced hydrogen, also modeling the intermittency of renewable energy at a 10-min resolution, and applied it to the case of Japan, to investigate quantitatively the possibility of achieving zero emission in 2050. Even if the costs of wind and solar PV decline drastically towards 2050 and the huge potentials that have been assumed in the literature are realized, the total system costs escalate significantly with very high shares of intermittent renewables. Since the use of hydrogen produced by excess electricity from renewable power generation sources can only make a slight contribution to reducing this escalation, it would be invaluable to introduce at least a significant amount of electricity generated by “zero-emission thermal power” technologies, including CO2-free imported hydrogen or conventional thermal power generation with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Nuclear power is also estimated as being effective in reducing the cost hike associated with achieving zero emissions. The results of this study could contribute to giving insights regarding global deployment of hydrogen-related technologies, as well as to presenting a frame of reference for Japan's future energy policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Today, almost 60% of the petroleum consumed in the United States is imported. The nation's current transportation system of systems (SoS) relies almost exclusively on refined petroleum products, accounting for over two-thirds of the oil used in the United States each day. As a nation, we must work to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil in a manner that is affordable, ensures national energy security, and preserves environmental quality. In the long term, a potential solution to the nation's transportation energy problems is an operational hydrogen-based transportation economy. Transitioning to any alternative transportation fuel on a national scale will require the creation of a robust and cost-effective system of systems that operates in concert with the dynamics of today's mature and highly-networked transportation infrastructure. Using a supply-chain point of view to trace the flow of transportation fuels through the necessary SoS, this paper addresses the current petroleum-based economy for transportation, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) vision for a future hydrogen-based transportation economy, and the significant challenges associated with such a massive market and infrastructure transformation. © 2008 by Midwest Research Institute.},

We propose herein a novel framework for optimizing hydrogen supply chains (SC) according to several environmental indicators. Our method comprises two steps. In step one, we formulate a multi-objective mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that accounts for the simultaneous minimization of the most relevant life cycle assessment (LCA) impacts. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is next employed in the post-optimal analysis of the MILP in order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of its solution space.

	abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the most promising energy carriers in the quest for a more sustainable energy mix. In this paper, a model of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) based on energy sources, production, storage, transportation, and market has been developed through a MILP formulation (Mixed Integer Linear Programming). Previous studies have shown that the start-up of the HSC deployment may be strongly penalized from an economic point of view. The objective of this work is to perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the major parameters (factors) and their interaction affecting an economic criterion, i.e., the total daily cost (TDC) (response), encompassing capital and operational expenditures. An adapted methodology for this SA is the design of experiments through the Factorial Design and Response Surface methods. Six key parameters are chosen (demand, capital change factor (CCF), storage and production capital costs (SCC, PCC), learning rate (LR), and unit production cost (UPC)). The demand is the factor that is by far the most significant parameter that strongly conditions the TDC optimization criterion, the second most significant parameter being the capital change factor. To a lesser extent, the other influencing factors are PCC and LR. The main interactions are found between demand, CCF, UPC, and SCC. The discussion has also shown that the calculation of UPC has to be improved taking into account the contribution of the fixed, electricity, and feedstock costs instead of being considered as a fixed parameter only depending on the size of the production unit. As any change that could occur relative to demand or CCF could strongly affect the response variable, more effort is also needed to find the more consistent way to model demand uncertainty in HSC design, especially since a long horizon time is considered for hydrogen deployment. © 2017, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {This work presents an integrative approach to environmental and cost assessment of current and future motorcycle technologies for four motorcycle size categories, three powertrain types, and a variety of fuel supply chains. We consider conventional gasoline (ICEV), battery electric (BEV) and fuel cell electric (FCEV) motorcycles with production years from 1990 to 2030. Motorcycle energy consumption is modelled based on the world harmonized motorcycle test cycle and calibrated with data measured from existing motorcycles. We model the potential future performance of motorcycles by adapting the model input parameters according to historic trends and future component performance predictions. We find that smaller motorcycles have much better environmental performance than larger motorcycles, though this is mostly due to the fact that larger motorcycles have different driving patterns: urban driving is found to have much lower environmental impact per kilometer than highway driving. Current BEV are found to have similar ownership costs to ICEV. They also have reduced climate change potential by roughly 60% when they are powered by electricity from natural gas, 80% when powered by renewables, and they still offer advantages over conventional motorcycles when charged with electricity from hard coal. Next generation BEV are found to have similar environmental performance advantages, though with a definite cost advantage. FCEV climate change reduction potential is found to depend strongly on the source of the hydrogen fuel, with climate benefits being substantial with hydrogen originating from renewable energy sources. Future cost competitiveness of FCEVs is linked closely to the development of fuel cell costs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Hydrogen-energy development could prevent global warming as well as ensure energy security for countries without adequate energy resources. The successful development of hydrogen would provide energy for transportation and electric power. It is a unique energy carrier, as it can be produced from various energy sources such as wind, fossil fuels and biomass and, when it is combusted, it emits no CO2 emissions. The other advantage is the wide distribution of resources globally that can be used to produce hydrogen. In Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) published a 'Strategic Roadmap for Hydrogen and Fuel Cells' in 2014, with a revised update published in March 2016. The goal of the roadmap is to achieve a hydrogen society. The roadmap aims to resolve technical problems and secure economic efficiency. The roadmap has been organized into the following three phases: Phase 1 - Installation of fuel cells; Phase 2 - Hydrogen power plant/mass supply chain; Phase 3 - CO2-free hydrogen.

	abstract = {The use of polymeric scale inhibitors has been ubiquitously accepted by the oil and gas industry for many years. There are many benefits to the use of this type of chemistry that include aspects such as high performance, scale species selectivity, enhanced brine compatibility, favorable environmental properties and high thermal stability. A very common way to manufacture polymeric scale inhibitors is via free radical polymerization. Here an initiator is used to propagate the generation of free radicals from a species, such as hydrogen peroxide. The initiator chemistry can be very varied and usually comprises different types of transition metal salts, hypophosphite or persulfate species. Different monomer units can be polymerized using different initiator and free radical species to yield the same polymer. However, subtle differences can result, including poly-dispersity, average molecular weight and different residual composition. The implications for the end user of the chemistry can be profound regarding performance differences in aspects such as detectability, compatibility, thermal stability and sometimes even scale inhibition and adsorption efficacy. A case study has been presented where a very commonly used sulfonated copolymer species from four different sources was evaluated in a whole host of compatibility and performance tests. The different routes used different combinations of hydrogen peroxide and transition metal initiator or persulfate/ hypophosphite combinations as the free radical source. There were major differences seen in the compatibility of these products with different scale inhibitors and then in performance. The tests performed highlighted the differences that can occur between the different radical polymerization synthetic routes mentioned above. The conclusions show that there are many benefits to being able to control the manufacturing process of scale inhibitor species in order to ensure the full composition is understood and can be quantified. The benefits to owning the supply chain are highlighted and lead to not only better control of quality and cost but, more importantly, to the overall risk reduction for the end user in the end use application.

Considering the importance of this issue, this study presents a mathematical programming optimisation model to help the HSC managers make robust strategic and tactical decisions related to HSC management. Generally, the HSC echelons include gathering raw material centres, production facilities and hydrogen distribution and storage centres. The proposed approach introduces a mix-integer linear programming (MILP) model optimising the HSC network at the strategic level of decision-making through minimising both capital and operational costs of the HSC. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is accomplished on the transportation cost of materials within the HSC network which constitutes the major share of total costs. Moreover, a numerical example is performed to demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed optimisation model. The obtained results confirm the capability of the presented model for HSC network optimisation. The main finding of the research indicated that hydrogen transportation cost is completely sensitive to HSC network structure. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Several roadmaps and international projects are interested in the development of the hydrogen economy for the transportation system. Yet, the development of a hydrogen economy suffers from a lack of infrastructure to store and supply H2 fuel to the refuelling stations, while at the same time, hydrogen can be just seen as one alternative among others to compete with the current fossil fuels. To determine if hydrogen is a competitive option, many scenarios must be assessed considering not only the cost as the target to determine the feasibility but, also environmental and safety objectives. This work is focused on the design of a hydrogen supply chain for deployment scenarios in the Midi-Pyrénées region in France based on multi-objective optimization. Specific constraints related to the energy sources have been integrated and a multi-period long-term problem is examined (2020-2050). Two solution strategies will be implemented to solve this multi-period problem: a global optimization through ε-constraint method and a sequential optimization through lexicographic and ε-constraint methods. The consideration of different geographical scales and the impact of the initiation step in the development of a sustainable supply chain have been highlighted.

	abstract = {The distribution of hydrogen in liquid state has several advantages because of its higher volumetric density compared to compressed hydrogen gas. The demand for liquid hydrogen (LH2), particularly driven by clean fuel cell applications, is expected to rise in the near future. Large-scale hydrogen liquefaction plants will play a major role within the hydrogen supply chain. The barriers of built hydrogen liquefiers is the low exergy efficiency and the high specific liquefaction costs. Exergy efficiency improvements, however, are limited by economic viability. The focus of this paper is to present a roadmap for the scale-up of hydrogen liquefaction technology, from state-of-the-art plants to newly developed large-scale liquefaction processes. The work is aimed at reducing the specific liquefaction costs by finding an optimal trade-off between capital costs and operating costs. To this end, two developed hydrogen liquefaction processes were optimized for specific energy consumption and specific liquefaction costs, showing the potential to reduce the specific liquefaction costs by 67% for a 100 tpd LH2 plant compared to a conventional 5 tpd LH2 plant while achieving a specific energy consumption between 5.9 and 6.6 kWh per kg LH2 with technology that is or will be available within 5 years. The results make liquid hydrogen a viable distribution route for hydrogen for mobility. © 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In this paper we present a decision-support tool to address the strategic planning of hydrogen supply chains for vehicle use under uncertainty in the operating costs. Given is a superstructure of alternatives that embeds a set of available technologies to produce, store and deliver hydrogen. The objective of our study is to determine the optimal design of the production-distribution network capable of fulfilling a predefined hydrogen demand. The design task is formulated as a multi-scenario mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) that considers the uncertainty associated with the coefficients of the objective function of the model (i.e. operating costs, raw materials prices, etc.). The novelty of the approach presented is that it allows controlling the variation of the economic performance of the hydrogen network in the space of uncertain parameters. This is accomplished by using a risk metric that is appended to the objective function as an additional criterion to be optimized. An efficient decomposition method is also presented in order to expedite the solution of the underlying multi-objective model by exploiting its specific structure. The capabilities of the proposed modeling framework and solution strategy are illustrated through the application to a real case study based on Spain, for which valuable insights are obtained. © 2010 Professor T.

Although most of the fundamental processing steps involved in biorefining are well-known, there is a need for a methodology capable of evaluating the integrated processes in order to identify the optimal set of products and the best route for producing them. The complexity of the product allocation problem for such processing facilities demands a process systems engineering approach utilizing process integration and mathematical optimization techniques to ensure a targeted approach and serve as an interface between simulation work and experimental efforts. The objective of this work is to assist the bioprocessing industries in evaluating the profitability of different possible production routes and product portfolios while maximizing stakeholder value through global optimization of the supply chain. To meet these ends, a mathematical optimization based framework is being developed, which enables the inclusion of profitability measures and other techno-economic metrics along with process insights obtained from experimental as well as modeling and simulation studies. © 2008 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

	abstract = {In this study the methodology of life cycle assessment has been used to assess the environmental impacts of three pulverized coal fired electricity supply chains with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS) on a cradle to grave basis. The chain with CCS comprises post-combustion CO2 capture with monoethanolamine, compression, transport by pipeline and storage in a geological reservoir. The two reference chains represent sub-critical and state-of-the-art ultra supercritical pulverized coal fired electricity generation. For the three chains we have constructed a detailed greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and disclosed environmental trade-offs and co-benefits due to CO2 capture, transport and storage. Results show that, due to CCS, the GHG emissions per kWh are reduced substantially to 243 g/kWh. This is a reduction of 78 and 71% compared to the sub-critical and state-of-the-art power plant, respectively. The removal of CO2 is partially offset by increased GHG emissions in up- and downstream processes, to a small extent (0.7 g/kWh) caused by the CCS infrastructure. An environmental co-benefit is expected following from the deeper reduction of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride emissions. Most notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in human toxicity, ozone layer depletion and fresh water ecotoxicity potential for which the CCS chain is outperformed by both other chains. The state-of-the-art power plant without CCS also shows a better score for the eutrophication, acidification and photochemical oxidation potential despite the deeper reduction of SOx and NOx in the CCS power plant. These reductions are offset by increased emissions in the life cycle due to the energy penalty and a factor five increase in NH3 emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aviation biofuels can help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States, help to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard for cellulosic biofuels, and improve US energy security. Cellulosic biofuels carry a lot of risk, because conversion technology is expensive. As a result, incentives are needed to reduce the risk for private investors. Government can implement policies to reduce the risk in investment in aviation biofuels. The issue is deciding which policy will provide the most reduction in risk, while providing a lowest cost to the government. This analysis focuses on aviation biofuel production using fast pyrolysis from corn stover. Cost benefit analysis is used to calculate the net present value, internal rate of return, and benefit-cost ratio for a plant. Uncertainty is added to fuel price and four technical variables: capital cost, final fuel yield, hydrogen cost, and feedstock cost using at Risk, a Palisade Corporation software. We look at the impact of two policies: reverse auction and capital subsidy. For the reverse auction and capital subsidy, we used contract lengths of 5, 10, and 15 years to see the impact a longer contract could have on probability of loss. Both policies reduced risk in investment of aviation biofuels. A reverse auction reduced risk of investment more. As the contract length increased, the probability of loss and coefficient of variation in net present value were reduced substantially. When fuel price increased stochastically and a contract length of 15 years was used, probability of loss was reduced to 18.4%. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {From 2004 to 2007 three hydrogen-powered fuel cell buses, known as EcoBuses, were trialled in the Perth, Western Australia public transport fleet. Hydrogen production, refuelling and support systems were also constructed to support the trial. The buses were placed on normal public transport routes and data was collected against a range of performance measures including reliability, efficiency, and public acceptance. Analyses of environmental impacts and costs were also undertaken. The objectives of the trial were to: • understand how limited production hydrogen bus and refuelling technologies would cope with the demands of a real world operational environment; • identify location-specific challenges associated with operation of hydrogen vehicles as well as hydrogen production, transport and refuelling facilities; and • inform the community and key decision-makers about potential advantages of a hydrogen-based transport system. The Western Australian Government, through the Department for Planning and Infrastructure, was the primary sponsor and manager of the trial. The Australian Government also contributed funding and BP provided in-kind support for the hydrogen supply chain and refuelling infrastructure. Major project partners included DaimlerChrysler, BP, BOC, Ballard Power Systems, the Public Transport Authority, Path Transit, Murdoch University and the Australian Greenhouse office. The Perth trial was run in association with similar trials in Europe, under the banner of the Clean Urban Transport for Europe (CUTE) project, and in Iceland (ECTOS). The trial was initially planned to run for two years but was subsequently extended for a third year. The extension operated in association with the European HyFLEET: CUTE program.},

	abstract = {The UK and the international community have an increasing interest in the benefits of a hydrogen-based economy. Existing and emerging technologies that are inherently carbon-neutral and potentially carbon-negative are increasingly attractive, given the challenge of meeting climate targets to prevent climate change and build a clean growth strategy. The integration of clean energy technologies across the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) can increase the flexibility of the energy system, driving efficiency, cost reduction and enhancing the value of natural resources. There are over 250 platforms and 45,000 kilometres of pipeline installed within the United Kingdom Continental Shelf (UKCS). As these assets near the end of their economic life oil and gas operators are planning to decommission these facilities in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Current cost forecasts for this activity exceed £58bn with approximately 50% borne by the operators and 50% borne by UK taxpayers. The Hydrogen Offshore Production (HOP) project identifies an alternative to decommissioning by providing re-use options for offshore infrastructure while addressing the national challenge of a low carbon energy supply. In doing so, the project will prove the feasibility of several decentralised hydrogen generation, storage and distribution options that collectively provide a scalable offshore hydrogen production solution, whilst offsetting a portion of decommissioning costs that are currently forecast for all offshore assets and infrastructure. HOP will tackle the challenge of bulk hydrogen production by (1) proposing viable environmental and economic technology solutions to be deployed offshore, (2) developing a new Industrial Hydrogen Production test site to both prove the industrial benefits and to aid commercialisation of emerging technology and, (3) conducting market analysis and producing the business case for the transformation of existing offshore infrastructure, re-purposing assets and demonstrating the viability for decentralised generation of hydrogen. As part of the project, an Industrial Hydrogen Production test site will be established with Flotta (Orkney Islands) being proposed as the location. This will provide a test bed for technology, fast-tracking its development and providing a route for accelerated commercial deployment. Within a region of considerable renewable energy generation, the island of Flotta is ideally placed to benefit from local expertise, existing supply chain and advanced technology solutions. For example, the Industrial Hydrogen Production test site would greatly benefit from lessons learnt at the nearby Orkney Water Testing Centre. Copyright 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers},

On the other hand, FCV (Fuel Cell Vehicle) using hydrogen have been on the market at the end of 2014. Introducing large mass hydrogen energy is being expected as expanding hydrogen applications, or solution to energy issues of Japan. And then, the Japanese government announced the road map for introducing hydrogen energy supply chain in June, 2014. Under these circumstances, imported CO2 free hydrogen will be one of the solutions for energy security and CO2 reduction, if the hydrogen price is affordable. To achieve this, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. (KHI) performed a feasibility study on CO2-free hydrogen energy supply chain from Australian brown coal linked with CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) to Japan. In the study, hydrogen production systems utilizing brown coal gasification and LH2 (liquid hydrogen) systems as storing and transporting hydrogen are examined. This paper shows the possibility of realizing the CO2 free hydrogen supply chain, the cost breakdown of imported hydrogen, comparison of power generation cost, and LH2 systems as key technologies of the hydrogen energy chain.},

It is of particular interest to investigate the spatio-temporal economic, environmental and energetic performance if H2 were to be introduced as a fuel in the Dutch transport sector. A key observation is that the transition towards a large-scale H2 supply infrastructure is economically viable, if designed optimally with a holistic long-term systems perspective. However, the well-to-tank (WtT) CO2 emission reduction potential is limited (ca. 30%), which can be improved (ca. 85%) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The spatially-explicit nature of the framework facilitates the design of efficient networks with a high network-wide WtT energy efficiency (ca. 50% or more). Furthermore, H2 is observed to have the potential to alleviate Dutch energy security concerns.

Past research has shown H-CNG can reduce tailpipe emissions of both criteria and greenhouse gas pollutants relative to diesel, CNG, and gasoline [1-3]. However, an unanswered question is how Delhi will satisfy the potential hydrogen demand in a sustainable manner. We conduct a techno-economic assessment of hydrogen production from gasification of the three most abundant agricultural residues near Delhi - rice straw, cotton stalk, mustard stalk - and find these residues could provide the city with up to 270,700 metric tons per year of hydrogen. This quantity far exceeds what is needed to run all existing CNG vehicles on 18%-82% H-CNG blends. The cost of each step of the biohydrogen supply chain is calculated and the total cost is estimated at 149.6 rupees ($3.39) per kg. Lastly, we show that the price of H-CNG at the pump would be roughly equivalent to CNG on a per mile basis. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The diffusion of smart energy systems at the local scale will lead to the implementation of innovative design, plans and applications mainly involving integrated energy infrastructures and distribution systems. In this framework, hydrogen will have the chance to play a major role but its penetration rate still represents a considerable uncertainty and needs to be investigated with special attention to show the real feasibility of a hydrogen economy advent. The paper presents the results obtained analysing a set of scenarios applied to a comprehensive TIMES-based bottom-up energy model developed to describe and assess the energy systems of the single European countries and of macroareas of the rest of the world in an integrated approach. The modelling tool considers the hydrogen supply chain since its production stage (together with its storage and distribution) and evaluates – minimising the total system cost and over a mid-long time horizon – the penetration of the hydrogen-based end-use technologies. The analysis shows that the residential and, above all, the transport sector may see a considerable diffusion of technologies supplied with hydrogen and especially for urban application, pushed by the upcoming stricter environmental constraints to the energy sector. © 2016 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Current ambitions to limit climate change to no more than 1.5 °C-2 °C by the end of the 21st century rely heavily on the availability of negative emissions technologies (NETs) - bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture in particular. In this context, these NETs are providing a specific service by removing CO2 from the atmosphere, and therefore investors would expect an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return, varying as a function of the quantity of public money involved. Uniquely, BECCS facilities have the possibility to generate both low carbon power and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but in an energy system characterised by high penetration of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power plants, the dispatch load factor of such BECCS facilities may be small relative to their capacity. This has the potential to significantly under utilise these assets for their primary purpose of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In this study, we present a techno-economic environmental evaluation of BECCS plants with a range of operating efficiencies, considering their full- and part-load operation relative to a national-scale annual CO2 removal target. We find that in all cases, a lower capital cost, lower efficiency BECCS plant is superior to a higher cost, higher efficiency facility from both environmental and economic perspectives. We show that it may be preferable to operate the BECCS facility in base-load fashion, constantly removing CO2 from the atmosphere and dispatching electricity on an as-needed basis. We show that the use of this 'spare capacity' to produce hydrogen for, e.g. injection to a natural gas system for the provision of low carbon heating can add to the overall environmental and economic benefit of such a system. The only point where this hypothesis appears to break down is where the CO2 emissions associated with the biomass supply chain are sufficiently large so as to eliminate the service of CO2 removal. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen liquefaction processes have effective function in the hydrogen supply chain. However low efficiency and high liquefaction costs are still the most important concerns about the liquefaction plants. In this study a new configuration for a hydrogen liquefier process is proposed and energy-exergy analyzed. The production rate of the liquid hydrogen (LH2) is 90 tons per day that can supply the required LH2 of at least 90 k-180 k hydrogen vehicles in an urban area that results in the reduction of pollutions caused by carbon dioxide emission. The process is simulated in Aspen HYSYS simulator. In addition, it is optimized thorough a trial and error approach that is a functional and simple method of complicated systems analysis. The process includes a mixed refrigerant (MR) refrigeration cycle that precools feed gas hydrogen from 25°C temperature to −199.9°C temperature. A new MR is used in a cascade Joule-Brayton cycle that deep-cools the low-temperature gaseous hydrogen from −199.9°C temperature to −252.2°C temperature in the cryogenic section of the plant. The novel process involves also an absorption refrigeration system (ARS) that cools some hydrogen streams in the precooling and cryogenic sections of the process. The consumed energy per kilogram of produced LH2 is achieved as 6.47kWh. This quantity is 2.89kWh in the ideal conditions. The exergy efficiency of the plant is evaluated to be 45.5% that is significantly more than the exergy efficiency of the in operating hydrogen liquefiers in the world. The energy analysis reveals that the coefficient of performance (COP) of the overall system is 0.2034. The achieved COP is a higher amount in compare to the other similar processes. A sensitivity analysis is done to show the effect of the various operation conditions of the process on the features of the plant. Accordingly, the optimum mass flow of the ARS is determined as 207kg/s for the proposed configuration. As well as, the effect of the change in the temperature approach of the heat exchangers and the changes in the adiabatic efficiency of the compressors and expanders on the SEC, COP, and the exergy efficiency of the overall plant is discussed. Furthermore, financial analysis of the plant estimates the capital expenditures (CAPEX), energy expenditures (EEX), and operational and maintenance expenditures (OMEX) as 25413 €2000, 7370 €2000, and 2033 €2000 respectively. These can be specially improved be improving of the exergy efficiency of the plant. The results implicates that the proposed configuration has better performance indicators than the in-service liquefiers. Therefore, LHL plant manufacturer can be considered it in the design and development of new plants. As well as, researchers may utilize its operating conditions to improve the proposed processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The diffusion absorption refrigeration (DAR) cycle is a technology of interest for cooling in rural areas and developing countries due to its low capital cost, low maintenance requirements, and unique design in which the requirement for electrically-driven components are fully omitted. The main feature of DAR systems is a thermally driven bubble pump that is used to circulate the refrigerant and absorbent fluid components around the system. In this paper, we present results from a laboratory DAR system operating over a range of pressures and heat input rates with ammonia-water-hydrogen as the working fluid. By reducing the system pressure from 21 bar to 14 bar, a 17% increase in maximum coefficient of performance (COP) is reported, and the system start-up time is reduced by up to 58%.

Given a superstructure of alternatives that embeds a set of available technologies to produce, store and deliver hydrogen, the objective of our study is to determine the optimal design of the production-distribution network capable of fulfilling a predefined hydrogen demand. The design task is formulated as a multiscenario mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) that decides on the production rates and expansions on capacity over time. The main novelty of the approach presented is that it allows controlling the variability of the economic performance of the hydrogen network at the design step in the space of uncertain parameters. This is accomplished by using a risk metric that is appended to the objective function as an additional criterion to be optimized. An efficient decomposition method is also presented in order to expedite the solution of the underlying mathematical model by exploiting its specific structure. The capabilities of the proposed modeling framework and solution strategy are illustrated through its application to a real case study based on Spain, for which valuable insights are obtained. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The systems analysis approach allows for explicit consideration of the interactions between feedstock collection, hydrogen production, and hydrogen distribution in finding the optimal system design. This case study approach provides insight into both the real-world potential and the real-world cost of producing hydrogen from waste biomass. Additional context is provided through the estimation of California's total waste biomass hydrogen potential. We find that enough biomass is available from waste sources to provide up to 40% of the current California passenger car fuel demand as hydrogen.

Within a future transport supply chain based on hydrogen (H2)-fueled proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), the energy efficiency constraint shifts to include not only the vehicle but also the process of producing H2 fuel. To address this constraint, this research analyzes an innovative approach for producing H2 fuel efficiently: tri-generative stationary high temperature (HT) fuel cell systems (FCSs) that simultaneously produce electricity, heat, and hydrogen fuel (H2-FCSs). This research discusses H2-FCS thermodynamics, chemical engineering process plant design, economics, and environmental impacts. Thermodynamic models indicate that H2-FCSs use ~19% less fuel to produce electricity, compared with standard stationary FCSs, and ~16% less fuel, compared with standalone steam methane reformers (SMRs).

	abstract = {A viable hydrogen infrastructure is one of the main challenges for fuel cells in mobile applications. Several studies have investigated the most cost-efficient hydrogen supply chain structure, with a focus on hydrogen transportation. However, supply chain models based on hydrogen produced by electrolysis require additional seasonal hydrogen storage capacity to close the gap between fluctuation in renewable generation from surplus electricity and fuelling station demand. To address this issue, we developed a model that draws on and extends approaches in the literature with respect to long-term storage. Thus, we analyse Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers (LOHC) and show their potential impact on future hydrogen mobility. We demonstrate that LOHC-based pathways are highly promising especially for smaller-scale hydrogen demand and if storage in salt caverns remains uncompetitive, but emit more greenhouse gases (GHG) than other gaseous or hydrogen ones. Liquid hydrogen as a seasonal storage medium offers no advantage compared to LOHC or cavern storage since lower electricity prices for flexible operation cannot balance the investment costs of liquefaction plants. A well-to-wheel analysis indicates that all investigated pathways have less than 30% GHG-emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel pathways within a European framework. © 2017 The Authors},

Sodium percarbonate is a key cleaning and stain removal technology delivering unbeaten removal of bleachable stains, at affordable cost; however incorporation of this ingredient into detergent formulations poses severe stability problems to be solved. Sodium percarbonate is an unstable chemical ingredient, which, naturally, over ageing decomposes generating initially hydrogen peroxide and in the end water plus molecular oxygen. This decomposition reaction is exothermic and autocatalytic. In order to preserve the chemical stability over ageing of dry detergents and to exclude the risk of thermal runaway during product supply chain, the formulation composition should be accurately designed and the storage conditions and the product purity should be carefully controlled. In this paper, we describe the key features of sodium percarbonate decomposition reactions in detergents and we critically discuss the applicability and the validity of the commonly used thermal runaway models (Semenov, Frank Kamenetski and Thomas) to study runaway risks of detergent formulations.

	abstract = {Purpose: The main goal of any life cycle assessment (LCA) study is to identify solutions leading to environmental savings. In conventional LCA studies, practitioners select from some alternatives the one which better matches their preferences. This task is sometimes simplified by ranking these alternatives using an aggregated indicator defined by attaching weights to impacts. We address here the inverse problem. That is, given an alternative, we aim to determine the weights for which that solution becomes optimal. Methods: We propose a method based on linear programming (LP) that determines, for a given alternative, the ranges within which the weights attached to a set of impact metrics must lie so that when a weighting combination of these impacts is optimized, the alternative can be optimal, while if the weights fall outside this range, it is guaranteed that the solution will be suboptimal. A large weight value implies that the corresponding LCA impact is given more importance, while a low value implies the converse. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous mathematical analysis on the implications of using weighting schemes in LCA, showing that this practice guides decision-making towards the adoption of some specific alternatives (those lying on the convex envelope of the resulting trade-off curve). Results and discussion: A case study based on the design of hydrogen infrastructures is taken as a test bed to illustrate the capabilities of the approach presented. Given are a set of production and storage technologies available to produce and deliver hydrogen, a final demand, and cost and environmental data. A set of designs, each achieving a unique combination of cost and LCA impact, is considered. For each of them, we calculate the minimum and maximum weight to be given to every LCA impact so that the alternative can be optimal among all the candidate designs. Numerical results show that solutions with lower impact are selected when decision makers are willing to pay larger monetary penalties for the environmental damage caused. Conclusions: LP can be used in LCA to translate the decision makers' preferences into weights. This information is rather valuable, particularly when these weights represent economic penalties, as it allows screening and ranking alternatives on the basis of a common economic basis. Our framework is aimed at facilitating decision making in LCA studies and defines a general framework for comparing alternatives that show different performance in a wide variety of impact metrics. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In addition to the economic objective, the model also incorporates an environmental objective of minimizing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, analyzing the trade-off between the economic and environmental considerations. The capital cost, operating cost, and revenues for the biorefinery facilities are based on techno-economic analysis, and the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study of Minnesota, with Minneapolis-St. Paul serving as the chemicals distribution hub. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The upgrade of sugarcane industry residues, such as vinasse and bagasse, has a notably potential for large scale production of biofuels in Brazil. Despite this fact, the biomass conversion into either electricity or biofuels requires various energy intensive processes that may drastically affect its technical and environmental competitiveness against their non-renewable counterparts. Accordingly, the mapping of the generation of the process irreversibility and their associated atmospheric emissions may help, by issuing appropriate mitigation tasks, in the reduction of exergy consumption rates and environmental impact. Therefore, in this paper, a comparative assessment between the total (ct) and non-renewable (cnr) exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions (cco2) of the electricity, methane and hydrogen produced from sugarcane vinasse and bagasse is presented and compared with the conventional (fossil fuel-based) supply chains. As a result, a strikingly high average renewable to non-renewable ratio (ccnrr ) of 15.2 is estimated for the biofuels derived from the waste upgrade plant. However, due to the larger number of process involved in the conversion of biomass resources, the total exergy costs of biofuels delivered vary from 2.6 to 2.2 times higher in comparison to those derived from fossil fuels. On the other hand, although hydrogen production from sugarcane wastes involves more processes, its unit exergy costs in the end-use stage (transportation service) were found to be the lowest among the studied biofuels, partially due to the higher efficiency of hydrogen-fueled transportation technologies. In general, the production of biofuels and electricity from sugarcane wastes can offer fuels with greatly reduced CO2 specific emissions and low non-renewable energy consumption shares. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

	abstract = {The focus of the paper concerns the current discussion on the contribution of the hydrogen economy to a "sustainable energy system". It considers whether advantages for the environmental situation and energy carrier supply can be expected from the already visible future characteristics of hydrogen as a new secondary energy carrier. Possible production paths for hydrogen from hydrocarbon-based, renewable or carbon-reduced/-free primary energy carriers are evaluated with respect to primary energy use and CO2 emissions from the fuel cycle. Hydrogen has to be packaged by compression or liquefaction, transported by surface vehicles or pipelines, stored and transferred to the end user. Whether generated by electrolysis or by reforming, and even if produced locally at filling stations, the gaseous or liquid hydrogen has to undergo these market processes before it can be used by the customer. In order to provide an idea of possible markets with special emphasis on the German energy sector, a technical systems analysis of possible hydrogen applications is performed for the stationary, mobile and portable sector. Furthermore, different "business as usual" scenarios are analysed for Germany, Europe and the World concerning end energy use in different sectors. The very small assumed penetration of hydrogen in the analysed scenarios up to the year 2050 indicates that the hydrogen economy is a long-term option. With reference to the assumed supply paths and analysed application possibilities, hydrogen can be an option for clean energy use if hydrogen can be produced with carbon-reduced or -free primary energy carriers like renewable energy or biomass. However, the energetic use of hydrogen competes with the direct use of clean primary energy and/or with the use of electric energy based on renewable primary energy. As a substitution product for other secondary energy carriers hydrogen is therefore under pressure of costs and/or must have advantages in comparison to the use of traditional energy carriers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The current hybrids manufactured and being proposed by the car companies from around the world has definitely shown fuel economy improvements. However, they have not shown how they will be a part of a path toward energy sustainability. There is currently much activity attempting to create a hydrogen based society to accomplish energy sustainability. This paper, however, will discuss the use of the Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) to accomplish Energy Sustainability in a much shorter time frame. Our planet is in trouble now and we need to transition away from burning oil without a change in our lifestyle. This paper introduces the concept of the PHEV or grid-chargeable, or grid option, or ehybrid. These are hybrid vehicles equipped with enough batteries to provide up to 100 km or 60 miles of all electric zero emission (ZEV) range. The hybrid electric vehicle has been introduced by a growing number of car manufacturers. This paper shows that using the basic concept of the HEV, a PHEV can be designed to weigh and cost no more but perform better, get over 2X fuel economy and have 1/10th the moving parts of a conventional vehicle. This paper discusses the technologies and supply chain needed for OEM adoption of the concept. An analysis of how these vehicles would be used by society will be presented and general computation results of emissions, green house gases, and fuel economy as well as annual fuel consumption will be discussed. The use of sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar, ethanol, biodiesel, etc will be discussed. Illustrations of vehicles developed and tested with specific "off the shelf" components that have a supplier will be shown. These PHEVs have shown improvements in fuel economy not possible with conventional technology and performance equal to or better than conventional vehicles at a small increase in cost.},

	abstract = {Much of the early research in the hydrogen supply chain area was focused on individual technologies of the supply chain, such as production, storage, or distribution, rather than dealing with the supply chain as a whole. The motivation behind this paper is the need to: (1) design a hydrogen supply chain that integrates the previously mentioned components within a single framework, (2) understand the important trade-offs in such a supply chain, and (3) have a full understanding of the data requirements and uncertainties in such an exercise. Optimization techniques were implemented to develop the hydrogen supply chain for the transport sector, therefore, determining the optimum infrastructural and operational costs. Of course, cost is not likely to be the sole determinant of performance in practice. The network of interest was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. Also, the network is presented as a steady state 'snapshot' problem using Great Britain as a backdrop. The model and assumptions presented in this paper reveal that the optimum future hydrogen supply chain might consist of medium-to-large, centralized methane steam reforming plants. The hydrogen produced from these plants will then be delivered as a liquid via tanker trucks and stored in centralized storage facilities. © 2006 Institution of Chemical Engineers.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, hydrogen is being promoted as an alternative energy carrier for a sustainable future. Many argue that its use as a transportation fuel in fuel cell vehicles offers a number of attractive advantages over existing energy sources, especially in terms of well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions. Following this interest, several of the leading energy companies, like BP, have started investigating strategies for its introduction. The challenge of developing a future commercial hydrogen economy clearly still remains, though: what are the energy efficient, environmentally benign and cost effective pathways to deliver hydrogen to the consumer? Establishing what these "best" pathways may be is not trivial, given that a large number of technological options exist and are still in development for its manufacturing, storage, distribution and dispensing. Cost, operability, reliability, environmental impacts, safety and social implications are all performance measures that should be considered when assessing the different pathways as viable long-term alternatives. To aid this decision-making process, we present a generic optimization-based model for the strategic long-range investment planning and design of future hydrogen supply chains. By utilizing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques, the model is capable of identifying optimal investment strategies and integrated supply chain configurations from the many alternatives. Realizing also that multiple performance criteria are of interest, the optimization is conducted in terms of both investment and environmental criteria, with the ultimate outcome being a set of optimal trade-off solutions representing conflicting infrastructure pathways. Since many agree that there is no one single template strategy for investing in a hydrogen infrastructure across the globe, emphasis is placed on developing a generic model such that it can be readily applied to different scenarios, geographical regions and case studies. As such, the model supports BP's strategic hydrogen infrastructure planning using high-level optimization programming, and is coined bpIC-H2. The features and capabilities of the model are illustrated through the application to a case study. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {One of the contenders for a clean source of on-board electric power in a vehicle is the fuel cell: an electrochemical device that transforms the chemical energy stored in a fuel directly into electricity. While less widely known less far advanced than batteries, fuel cells hold a considerable potential to provide the power for a novel generation of non-polluting vehicles. At present, fuel cell technology is entering the stage of commercialization, which is an appropriate moment to try and assess its economic potential in the field of transport. Based on a review of the present state of the technology, concentrating on the solid polymer fuel cell, a model is set up of a fleet of urban buses, widely regarded as one of the earliest applications of fuel cells in transport. Under the central assumption that the fuel cell stack cost is $300 per kilowatt, the fuel cell bus is found to be around 30% more expensive than its diesel counterpart. However, there are considerable cost reductions possible through economies of scale in the production of hydrogen, the fuel required for the solid polymer fuel cell. Remarkably, these economies of scale allow the cost of the fuel cell bus to drop below that of the diesel. What is more, the fleet size required for this - more than 25 vehicles - is by no means prohibitive. In a trade-off analysis, the possibility is investigated of reducing the cost by allowing one parameter to deteriorate, if this permits another one to improve. In particular, it is found that cheaper (mass-) production techniques for the fuel cell at the expense of reduced efficiency make economic sense if a relative drop in the efficiency of 1% is accompanied by a cost reduction of at least 1.06% - something that is likely to be attainable. A scenario for a direct methanol fuel cell, assuming a cost per kilowatt three times as high as for the solid polymer fuel cell, results in a slightly higher overall cost, without being able to offer the same economies of scale in fuel provision. The social costs are calculated also, taking into account the environmental externalities associated with the whole system including the fuel supply chain. The inclusion of externalities fails to shift the balance decisively in favour of the fuel cell, partly because of a cancellation effect between the diesel tax, which has to be excluded in a social cost calculation, and the externalities, which are added in. The main outcome is therefore that in order to succeed in the marketplace, the principal task for the developers of fuel cells is a further reduction of the cost. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
